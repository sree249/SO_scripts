0,auupxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/auupxx/dilemma_with_an_adjunct/,Dilemma with an adjunct,"I  have a dilemma and I’m hoping to get input. 

I’m taking a Lit course this semester. I am formerly a Lit Major ( now a History Major) and so am familiar with the format and expectations in writing up literary analysis. So far we have had 3 writing assignments and I’m having trouble understanding the adjunct instructor’s rationale for grading. I’ve been told that my writing is “over erudite” , “ too complicated” , and that the “language is too complex “. 

The grades I’m receiving on these assignments reflects the instructor’s comments. I have not had this kind of feedback from any professor so far in my experience at University. Obviously I am perplexed by this because 
a) I have several tenured professors that routinely have praised my writing. 
b) I am a non-traditional older student ( mid 40’s) and the voice/tone I use in writing essays, term papers , reviews, etc tends to be representative ( I think) of my age, maturity level, and (compared to traditional college aged students) a more sophisticated/informed world view. 

The written comments in the margins of the assignments indicate to me that the instructor seems to expect a full understanding of the content immediately. They seem unwilling to simply read the content, and let it unfold. Having no patience to read through the material and digest some of the nuance of what is being articulated before scribbling out notes like “I don’t understand what you’re getting at”, only to later jot out a quick “Ahh, I see now” when the writing has achieved its intended goal. 

Anyway, here’s where it gets interesting; 
I got an assignment back today but did not realize that the instructor also gave me the graded paper of another student mixed in with my paper. I didn’t catch the snafu until well after class. 
So I read this student’s paper ( I couldn’t resist) and then see that they received an A, and my paper apparently only warranted a B- ... needless to say I’m more than agitated. Closer to livid actually. 
The writing for the instructor’s version of an A paper is lacking in basic form, simplistic, and uninsightful by my humble estimation. 

I have already had a previous conversation with the instructor about expectations, and as a result I’ve actually tried a sort of “dumbing down “ of my writing. But it’s insulting and unjust. 

What is a tactful, level headed way to address this? What would be an effective strategy in trying to talk to the instructor about this? Or would that be fruitless? The entire situation is infuriating. ",12,0

Hi internet hive mind,

Hoping you can help. I've had a super negative long term work experience, with 8+ people having had similar experiences with the same terrible manager and his wife (who we all know fucked her way to the top). 

I'm in academia, so there's arguably fewer protections here, but I have collaborated with many of the other people that were unhappy and I'm spear heading an official letter of complaint to submit to a higher level of university HR. 

Do you have any tips or tricks or resources that you can share? I'm looking for specific phrases that are more effective than others (exhibit a: I just said someone fucked their way to the top, I don't think I should phrase it like that). 

I don't want to get anyone fired, genuinely. This just has to stop, or at least get some sort of closer look. Some of the issues we faced frequently were: 

\- chronically under-managed with no communication

\- followed up by micromanaging flurries of rage and hyperactive scrutiny

\- unclear communications about projects that we were (I am in a happier job, just FYI) given at the last minute and that fell solidly outside our job description, even the ""other duties as assigned""

\- aggressive behaviors and bullying tactics when we raised concerns about schedule constraints, unreasonable deadlines, lack of direction

\- unexplained absences for at least half of the work day, in direct contravention of a ""working overseas"" agreement I KNOW they had to sign. 

I appreciate any help I can get! I understand with academia you can get some ""strong personalities"" (IMO a weak excuse used by even weaker people to never critically examine their own management styles) but the way this played out for everyone on the team for the past four years just got ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Any advice on how to phrase official complaint letter (signed by many people) to raise concerns about a manager in academia creating a hostile work environment?

5,aq7zm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/aq7zm3/im_not_able_to_be_a_good_student/,I'm not able to be a good student,"Hi!

warning-this is going to be mainly a vent.
 I'm so bummed out right now and it's been like this for a few days.

I have always been kinda shy type student, it wasn't like this  always but ever since high school. And now in college, it's been proving to be quite problematic for me.
I have troubles talking, discussing my doubt in class with professors. And not just in class, but even outside the classrooms, I don't always approach them thinking they'll think I'm so stupid compared to my peers that I didn't even get this thing right.

My professors are all very nice and encourage students to always ask when they have doubt but I, being a dumbass never ever talk to them. One or two times, I did actually talked to them, it was after re-revising the thing in my head many times before I uttered a word.

 And recently, I needed recommendations to apply for an REU at a place I was interested in, but ended up not applying because I thought no professor really 'knows' me so what's the point of asking a letter from them?

Sometimes I think that it may be because I'm the kind of student who doesn't 'get' everything taught in class immediately, I actually have to go look my notes/book, try to understand the material better in my own before I'm able to come up with things I might have a doubt over.
And this doesn't mean I'm lazy or anything, I try my best in everything, just my study style doesn't match up with the majority.

And I guess my profs expect me to come up with questions like others, who quickly grasp everything, and it's making me disappointed with myself that I'm unable to do that. 

And the coursework this semester, is so huge that reading the topic ahead of every class just so I kinda already know the material is also impossible.
On top of it, just because there are one or two people in one of my class, who are doing their independent studies in the same area as that course and so kinda have the motivations to do things in the course already and hence are able to ask things in class is making me more irritated with myself.

And I am very annoyed at myself for not being the same as my peers who are normal, not shy or inconfident or anything and I wish I could just take a pill or something and be like them as my profs expect me to.

Thanks for reading, in case you have.

I don't really expect any replies to this post but if anyone's gone through the same shit and would like to share something, it would be great.

 P.S.: Sorry if this is in a wrong sub, I didn't know where else to post it and don't know how to move it to another.

EDIT 14/02/2019- Thank you everyone for your advices and kind words. This whole thread has been very uplifting and has motivated me to change the way I was going about attending lectures. I have started making an effort to talk to professors step by step and hope to continue this way the whole semester. Also, I will read the comments here from time to time until these new habits get instilled in me.
So, once again, thanks everyone! ",14,11

Or might I be able to go without it?","I'm asking here because I'm in biology, and no one I work with does survey research. But my research is human-based and this survey gets incorporated into biological results.   


The metrics are the Short Dark Triad (I'm missing three questions from the psychopathy subsection), the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, and the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale. Our goal is to use these metrics, which are highly correlated with sexually coercive behavior, to identify some potentially coercive individuals to do some follow-up tests. Missing part of the psychopathy section might not be that big of a deal, but no one else I know does anything like this, so I don't know who to ask.  


In case you're curious, we missed these three questions when we put them in the survey because, in the paper in which they were published, they had ended up on the top of the next column, which we didn't see because we read it on a computer instead of on a paper, so it was hard to ""see"" the full set of questions.

I have a liberal arts background but switched to IT with a minor in mathematics. I'm interested in pursuing research in data science. 

This summer will be my first research experience in CS (in NLP) at a top tech company. I have received two competitive scholarships from top tech companies (one had a research component), and also have won various hackathons. I'll be participating in my first datathon this year. I have a strong GPA + recommendation letters.

However, people are telling me that my non-traditional background, lack of research experience (I'm in my Junior year and will be working on my first project this summer), combined with the fact that I go to a small university that's not well-known pretty much destroy my chances of getting into a top PhD program without a Master's. 

Is that true? I prefer not getting a Master's because of my age, and also because I cannot afford it. Should I give up my dreams of getting a PhD at a top university and doing research to work for a big tech company instead?

&amp;#x200B;

I was a graduate assistant to the senior vice provost of my university when I was finishing an M.S. in applied statistics. My contribution was statistical analysis for a survey that was distributed by the SVP and his colleagues across a few universities. They then wrote and published a book based on the results of their research - the portion that my SVP wrote included a lot of the results and figures of my analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

I was mentioned in the foreword/acknowledgement section of the book for my contribution - is this something I can/should put on a CV/Resume? I (rightly) wasn't listed as an author - my role was entirely a post-design statistician - but figured I would see if anyone has any thoughts about including this on a resume and if so, how it should be listed. I currently list the assistantship on my resume as a position I held and mention in the description that portions of my analysis are in the book, but not sure if that's the most effective/appropriate way to display this (or if it's appropriate at all).

I was just recently inducted into my first year of PhD and was told by an admin member that we are not given desks but need to book the desks online when we want to use them.

I've recently joined a new university, and my project supervisor put me in contact with another department member for help in an aspect of my work. At first they were very helpful, having a meeting with me and giving me some suggestions for my work. However, they had planned to assist me in an aspect of my work and I gladly agreed. When I sent an email asking when they would like to begin the work, I received no reply for 3 days. The work is time sensitive and I had seen them around the building today at about 17.00, and so I decided to go to their office and just ask them in person what their plans were. When I knocked on their door, they looked visibly irritated by my being there and rudely told me to come in, and then said they hadn't replied to me because they were unsure of their schedule for the following few days and were waiting to hear if they needed to attend a meeting on one of the days I had suggested we meet. I was quite shocked at how visibly bothered they were that I had come to see them and I very quickly apologised, and (after they said the work was nothing difficult, though to me it is very different and new) assured them I did not need their assistance on the day (and hopefully I won't, I do have faith in my own abilities and if not then it is a learning curve). 

Am I wrong for thinking that a more professional approach would have been to just fire off a quick email letting me know their schedule was unclear, and that i should go ahead with my plans and they'd try and check in on me from time to time (which is what they ended up suggesting anyway)? I understand academics are very busy people, but not replying to emails at all for days when you've offered personal help seems unfair to me. 

In our very first meeting they bad-mouthed a student of theirs who was waiting outside their office without an appointment, and I am now afraid that they will say similar things about me to other students or staff. Am I over-thinking this? Please let me know.",5,9

A few years ago, I connected with ""Joelle"", largely because we had similar research interests and because she got a (TT) faculty position I applied for but didn't get. Three years later, I have grown to dislike working with Joelle. Among other things:

\-She desperately wanted to write a grant with my undergrad mentor, who's a big name researcher in this specific area, but my mentor was like ""She has no substantial research background in this area--this is too risky. I'll collaborate with you, however!"" Joelle ended up bugging my mentor so much that my mentor blocked her on Facebook.

\-She lies about her publication record. She consistently claims to have something like 30 peer-reviewed publications and 10 first-authors, but searching on google scholar brings up a record that more like 10 and 3.

\-She doesn't seem to understand the basics of publishing. She read a rejection letter for a manuscript and insisted repeatedly it was a revise-resubmit decision until I asked to see it, where it was clearly a rejection. She also doesn't understand things like ""You have to reply to reviewer comments in a revise and resubmit decision.""

\-Her writing is poor. Like, ""why would you put those words in that order?"" poor.

\-She's consistently pressured me to put pressure on people I know in the field to do things like accept her manuscripts or write grants with her.

\-She consistently pressures me to move up her authorship order on manuscripts.

\-She calls me at random times (7pm on a Friday, 10 am on a Saturday, etc) unannounced and expects me to pick up. Would I do that for a close collaborator, someone where we're in a serious time crunch. or a close friend? Yeah. But it seems invasive coming from her.

22,amiaua,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/amiaua/most_papers_are_a_terrible_presentation_of/,Most papers are a terrible presentation of scientific results - Change my mind,"This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine and I am interested if this is something that other people agree with. But first a bit of background: I am a postdoc in bioinformatics. As a bioinformatician I have no strong ties to any particular research community and I read papers from medical, biological, statistical, biochemical, mathematical and computer scientific backgrounds. Each field and each subfield comes with their own landmark papers, jargon and notations. To me, reading papers is more difficult, because I am often not aware of many things that the authors take for granted. But in all fairness, I know that a lot of researchers are very deep inside their research subfield and people tend to know what certain notations and expressions mean. And that is fine with me.

With this situation in mind, I still want to make the case for ""most papers are a terrible representation of scientific results"" because I feel that most papers impose an unnecessary burden on the readers.

Let us first consider the purposes of a paper (according to my own understanding):

&amp;#x200B;

1. Describe and present scientific results
2. Explain the motivation for the work
3. Explain how the results fit into the bigger picture

&amp;#x200B;

Let's talk about these in detail:

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Describe and present scientific results:** There is usually a main result that makes it into the title of the paper. The first figure (if there is one) often supports the main result. So far so good. But after that I feel that the Results sections tend to be just an agglomeration of additional pieces of results. A lot of details with numbers intermingled with text. For the reader it is very difficult to see what else could be of interest. It feels like people are trying to squeeze as many results as possible into the paper (or its suplement).

In a similar fashion, many Material &amp; Methods sections are very unpleasant to read. A lot of these sections contain the description of procedures in prose form. I suppose that journals dislike lists in papers, but lists are actually the perfect stylistic element to represent procedures. Short list are also great for parameters for machines/software. Speaking of software: I find it very upsetting when the source code that produced the results is not available. As a programmer I prefer to read code instead of human-readable text. Simply because code is unambigious and contains all necessary details.

The Discussion is usually the most readable part. It is where one can get a better idea about what the paper is actually about (if the abstract was not clear enough). The authors often emphasize the improvements over the state of the art in the beginning of this section. After that the reader might get lucky if the authors go on a tangent that is of interest to the reader. To me, this has been rarely the case. But I am probably not the primary audience in most cases.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Explain the motivation for the work:** This part is about the ""why"" of the project. The motivation for the project is usually burried somewhere in the text and easy to overread. This might not seem like a big issue, but the decisions that the authors made while doing the project probably depended on that motivation and it is easier to understand a paper when the motivation is known. I think the motivation should be displayed more prominently on papers.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Explain how the results fit into the bigger picture:** I guess most papers are fine in this regard. I suspect that people are afraid of not putting enough references into their papers ;)

It has quite a few spelling mistakes, typos, and sentences that were just carelessly written/phrased. The associate editor specifically mentions these mistakes and the ""level of carelessness"". I went back and looked through the last draft I had edited and sent the PI to make sure the spelling, etc errors weren't from me. 

Is there a way for me to ask that she doesn't submit final versions of things we are working together on without me being able to look at it first?

So, I think I'm in a strange situation right now. I had to leave my PhD a few months ago due to some reasons at this very fancy uni in my country (has a good international reputation).

It was mostly because, the faculty I was working with was a kind of bully and working with him for a long time would work affected my mental health significantly. 
I have a paper published in a journal from that time I worked with him.

I kept no contact with that prof after I left that place to keep myself same and while I was leaving, I did not argue or fight with him or anyone just because it's not professional and also because I'm not an idiot and our paths may cross sometime in the future. So, you can say that I went on my seperate way quite peacefully with no drama. 

Now, after months I'm reapplying for a PhD mainly to Europe and some North American universities. And I am being advised to take his recommendation letter and being told that I should talk to him because he will be contacted since I have a paper with him so it's better that I talk to him myself. And some even said that I'm sabotaging my career by not talking to him and should just put up with it. And that the worst he can do is say no.

But given the dynamics of my relationship with him I don't really want to email him again and ask for a favor.

What do you think is advisable in this situation? Thanks!

Tl;dr- left PhD due to toxic supervisor relationship, had a paper published with him, did no drama while leaving and left very peacefully you can say, reapplying elsewhere, do I get his recommendation?

I'm part of a postgrad student team organising an interdisciplinary conference, entitled **‘Conflicting Technologies: Public Surveillance and Personal Privacy’.** The conference will be held at Queen's University Belfast on **3rd May 2019**, in partnership with the University’s Leverhulme Interdisciplinary Network on Cybersecurity and Society (LINCS) programme.
 
We welcome papers from academics and PhD students at **any** stage of their research, who are willing to present and discuss their work alongside a panel of other researchers. Masters and undergrad students are very welcome to submit an abstract too, if this is something they would be interested in. This conference will be a totally friendly and supportive environment - a perfect opportunity to practice presenting your research for the first time! 

Each panel will address a different thematic area related to the broader themes of surveillance, privacy and the intersection of cybersecurity and social science.
 
Papers may consider the following topics:
* The impact of digital surveillance on policing and criminal justice
* The collection and use of personal data and how this might infringe upon legal rights
* Smart cities and the datafication of public space
* The politics of governmental surveillance
* ‘Hacktivism’ and the right to privacy and anonymity
 
The above topics are indicative. Due to the interdisciplinary and wide-ranging nature of the conference’s subject matter, all submissions concerning surveillance and personal privacy will be considered. 
 
Please submit an abstract of up to 100 words for the presentation of a paper of between 10-15 minutes duration before 15th March 2019 to lincspgconference@qub.ac.uk.

However right now I have offers for both Biomedical engineering and science school form one of the universities I applied to. Cost will be same. If I chose Biomedical, I go in with a major declared. If I chose science school I'll have one or even two years to declare my major, so there'll be time for experimentation. (In science school I'll try to manage a double major in Physics and Biology if I can manage it, otherwise I'll probably go with Physics though I'm equally interested in both). In the end I hope to settle on a field by graduate school. So from graduate school point of view, what would be the better choice? Science school or directly Biomedical engineering?
Also, I from what I know neither of these would get me a proper job with just a bachelor's, (financials are important for me but idt a business degree or most others engineering degrees (being quite narrowly focused) would satisfy me) but if that's not the case could you guys give details regarding that as well?

I deeply enjoy learning, and try to take as many courses at my institutions as I possibly can at once, often having to write appeals so I can take on extra courses. With this I also do my best to put together a plan to complete on my personal time, and I model it as if it were from an institution. I really enjoy this practice, and working through my designed studies but I tend to have trouble getting a quality structure for a particular course. 

Normally what I do is decide on what I want to learn next, right now it is a Intro to Logic. Upon deciding on a topic, I then detail if I will need prerequisites or if i can dive right in. In the current example with the Logic course, I have taken multiple philosophy courses in the past so I dove right in. With a more complicated topic I would create a course plan that would build up. Once I have decided on the topic, and whether or not I need to take preemptive course, I begin looking for materials. 

This is where I am looking for assistance. There is no shortage of textbooks, but it is very difficult finding a quality book. In a normal college setting, the professor has a required text that they feel best fits within the lesson of that they are teaching. With that suggested book, there will also be some resources or course plan. These will often be listed on the syllabus, stating week-by-week what will be gone over and any major resources used. 

I have no issue using the templates on college websites to line up which courses to be taken in which order, but as for the content of those courses I want to ensure it is quality. Often I ask my friends that are in school to save their syllabus', course materials, and course outlines so that I can take them and use them for my personal studies. That way I know that the materials are in some way credible, reliable, and proven to a degree. I have amassed a decent amount of materials, books, and courses from a variety of colleges, universities, and schools but my collection is not all too extensive. 

I am trying to create a full course plan for myself that could be sufficiently compared to what one would get when enrolling in a college or university. I plan to set up a schedule of courses to be completed in semester increments and that will slowly build over time. 

If this is not the proper place to post this, I apologize and I will post it wherever it is appropriate. But any advice, suggestions, or input would be greatly appreciated. I would be more than happy to further clarify if needed. ",0,2

I am wrapping up my dissertation and I am deciding if I should post my thesis on ArXiv.

&amp;#x200B;

The reasons I am leaning towards doing so are basically the same as the top answer to this [question](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/78228/should-i-post-my-phd-thesis-on-arxiv-if-i-intend-to-make-a-paper-based-on-it). Namely that I am writing a thesis that has some chapters that bring together a lot of material that I have not seen published together in this context. Those chapters are not publish worthy, but I would like to be able to easily reference them in future work and for people to actually be able to find that reference. I personally have had a hell of a time looking for other folk's thesis when the only place they are stored is at their university. It seems that each university has their own systems of storing these and none of them are great. Also (as that answer also mentions) I would like to be able to offer an errata to any readers without having them hunt it down.

&amp;#x200B;

I have reservations of course. At my current career stage I am basically a no body so I don't love the idea of someone scrolling through arxiv updates and seeing ""astrogate1's Awesome Thesis!!!"" and have them think I am arrogant for thinking my thesis deserves special attention.

It's not always a dream job. I recently left a position for the private sector, and although I have experienced occasional pangs of regret, they're fading, especially as I quantify the differences [LONG].","The recent spate of ""quit lit"" usually is written by people who were adjuncts or lecturers or post-docs for years, and finally realized they were never going to make it into the ""dream"" tenure track job. Recently (because of my own experience) I've been looking for examples of folks who were in actual tenure-track jobs and left, and found far fewer examples.

Maybe I'm unusual, I don't know. But I would *urge* those in graduate programs-- and even those in academic positions-- to consider whether you really want to be there. You *do* have options. Don't stay in a job that makes you miserable because you think it's a problem with you. It may just be a problem with the fit, or with the job as a whole. Not everyone is cut out for academia, even those who make it in!

Before my PhD I worked (with a master's) in the private sector as an archaeologist. I decided I wanted to go back for a PhD because I wanted to reach that milestone. I knew the academic job market was tight, but I don't regret it in the slightest. I made it. Got the tenure track job and all. 

And I found that I *hated* it.

---

When I finished my PhD I went on the academic job market. Numerous applications, no offers. I began working in the commercial side of things in my field, but because of conditions there-- I made the stupid mistake of signing a non-compete that was probably unenforceable, but could still have cost me a ton in legal fees-- I decided to have another go at academia. After a second round of applications, I was offered a tenure track job. Hooray!

Pay was better than many of my friends who had also gotten t-t jobs. The teaching load was heavy (4/4) but (I thought) manageable. And the research requirements were relatively low.

I worked constantly. Weekends, mornings, evenings. I put hours into my lectures. The students loved me, I got great reviews and evaluations. I wrote (and won) grants, and I published. Not nearly as much as I wanted to, though. 

On my first annual review, my department chair told me that I needed to spend *more* time on my teaching. I was a little taken aback. I didn't argue with him, but my initial response in my head was, ""How?""

I realized that his view was that if I was doing research (and I talked about that a lot because I was excited about it) that was time that could be better devoted to teaching. Uh oh.

One faculty meeting, the folks from our Research and Grants Office came to talk to us. I had already worked with them several times since I'd been there, writing and submitting. I happened to sit down with them and chat before their presentation, and I realized belatedly that my department colleagues were on the other side of the room. At that moment, I became aware that in the year that I'd been there, I'd probably worked with those folks more than my department colleagues had in the entire time they'd been there. Uh oh, again.

After my second year, I thought I'd be able to put my teaching on *a little* autopilot and focus more on getting some of my research into pubs. I had been literally in the office at 6am every morning, and there most weekends, working on lectures for new preps for the last two years, and figured I could now devote a little more time to writing. I don't like being trapped somewhere, and I saw my diminishing pub record (especially compared to my friends at other universities) as a liability if I ever wanted to go somewhere else.

So I was pretty pissed when my teaching load was changed and classes that I'd taught for two years were going to have to be entirely reconfigured to a new schedule. So much for more time for research and writing. Uh oh #3.

I'd had it. I spent every moment of my time on the job, got ""you need to spend more time on teaching,"" my class schedule rejiggered because ""enrollment was down,"" and my CV was getting dusty.

I submitted my resignation in early August and started looking for jobs outside academia. It took my a few months, but fortunately I had a substantial savings built up. And then in late November / early December I was offered a job.

I've since done some calculations.

My field is anthropology / archaeology. So we're not 6-figure salary folks except at the highest levels.

My t-t contract was 9 months, $65k / year when I left academia. I'd received one raise of a little less than $1000 from when I started, and I'd been told that raises had been unheard of for years. Ouch.

During my 9 months when I was being paid, I worked mornings, evenings, weekends, holidays... I had a few days off here and there, but I was always working on some level. And then during the 3 months I wasn't technically being paid, I was working on research, writing, class prep. 

My new job pays slightly more ($67,500 / year) for 12 months. That doesn't sound like a huge difference, but consider...

I can treat this job as essentially a 9-5. My work consists of a combination of field archaeology and writing, not to mention working in different places, managing people, working outdoors occasionally. It's billed to clients. We don't work off the clock. We can't. That's how we get paid. I don't work weekends, or nights, or mornings, unless I want to, or on the occasions that I'm actually in the field running a crew. And then I'm paid, and compensated. And my time off is my own, even if it's (on paper) far less than what I got as an academic. I get holidays where I don't have to work. Weekends are mine again.

If you break down the amount of time that I will work, even over 12 months, compared to how much I was working on a 9-month contract, the difference is *substantial*.

Even better, I don't have to cease my academic research and publication, but I can do them on my own time. It's no longer a requirement of my job. I enjoy it, and I plan to continue it. I have work with colleagues I'm engaged in, data from my dissertation that I've yet to publish.

I reviewed a paper two days before I started my new job. I took a break from working on a paper to write this. My contribution to the discipline is not over, and in fact, I may be able to actually do *more* now that I can treat it as *fun* rather than a job.

And raises are a regular occurrence. As is merit-based advancement.

---

I realize that some of this is specific to the type of university (small, public university) that I was at. Not everyone will have the same experience. Not everyone has. Clearly many people *love* the academic life.

But it's not for everyone. The warnings about work-life balance are something I always laughed off, but it's real.

I watched my colleagues teach teach teach and publish almost nothing. I saw them do virtually no research, and yet still earn tenure. I heard them telling me to try to recruit majors... at a small public university where the students are mostly from the region, and may not ever leave, an anthropology major is not going to be something that people can support themselves on.

I couldn't participate in the racket any longer. I wasn't willing to work myself to the bone constantly, and to have no time when I could put work aside and just enjoy something else without thinking ""I should be working on a lecture / paper.""

I get that many people love academia and wouldn't want to be anywhere else. I think that's great.

But consider *very* carefully if you could be happier in another part of your field before going too far down that road. Even tenure-track positions are not all they're cracked up to be.",31,72
