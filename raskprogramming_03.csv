What I mean by this is a language where one could define macros to redefine keywords, redefined what for loops look like, and basically redefine the syntax of the entire language (of course, like TeX, the original syntax would remain valid; I do not mean this `redefine'). 

There are, of course, languages with macro capability; what I'm asking about is a language where you can literally redefine the entire look of it.

That causes a problem for \[programX safeProgramThatExecutesVirusIfRequested  randomInput\], because even a random input may cause the virus behaviors, if the random bits happen to be the virus or maybe half the possible inputs cause virus behaviors. If a program can run 1 particular virus, and we've seen it run maybe 20 nonviruses, then statistically 5% chance of the next random input being a virus. Probably lower, but also many more calls of it negates that advantage. People ask me to both trust safeProgramThatExecutesVirusIfRequested  AND they claim it may excecute virus behaviors, but I should call it anyways. Its not t heir fault, cuz they're calling some other binary blob that may on some inputs execute virus behaviors. Its outside our control. Since its outside my control what such a call will do, I should not call it. Its a mindless automaton, if we're lucky and dont get a program out to get us in some basic way. The mindless automaton is undeserving of trust without understanding its behaviors from its code. The halting problem proves that no thought process, which is a subset of computing process (such as statistical thoughts), proves that statistics of how often a program executes virus behaviors have no effect, beyond some constant (like we might know 80% of programs certainly end quickly and simply every time)... has no effect on future statistics. Chaitins constant doesnt have lower digits that we can ever know, the chance a program will halt, because we just cant know without running the program all the way through what it will do. If you say virus instead of halt, it works the same. So when people say trust a program because it has not executed a virus ever or recently, that is not something statistics repeat for. Next statistics are independent of earlier statistics, like a weighted coin flip. We should not learn to trust the weighted coins that rarely fail, or the fair coins that have so far not failed (newcombs paradox?). Halting problem etc is not limited to computers. It is also a flaw in Human minds, that we cant know for sure if some thought process will ever find an answer or if we will go ever deeper into subgoals and theres just nothing to find, or worse that we cant choose to do something else but dont know that we cant choose.

As long as the halting problem runs wild, I will not let it in, nor your programs which may contain it.

I want to build a web app and hopefully make it into a startup. It will be similar to https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-150-master-rich-chocolate. My current career path is in chemical engineering in Germany. Should I switch careers to software development? I would earn less money (averages: 45.000 Euros / year as Frontend Javascript developer vs. 63.000 Euros / year as a chemical engineer), but I would earn knowledge that would help me in the development of the web app. Is less money worth the programming experience?

**Elaboration:**

I want to build a web app, and, if I can prove demand, make it into a startup. It will be similar to this 
https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-150-master-rich-chocolate
. Basically, the app should help users scale recipes to fit their personal nutritional needs. Let’s call it “taylored food”. I need a frontend so users can create new recipes, add ingredients and add amounts. It should have a database (MongoDB) with the nutritional information for a lot of ingredients. When the user has added the recipe and his nutritional profile, some python calculations are done, and the final recipe is shown back to the user.

I will be working a full time job while developing “taylored food” on the side (plan: 15 hours per week). After 4 – 5 years, I plan to quit the full time job and pursue the startup full time. I should have built up enough savings and work experience by then.

The question is: should I get a full time job as a web developer, or as chemical engineer? 

Pro chemical engineering:

I am currently finishing my Master’s in chemical engineering in Germany. A job as a chemical engineer would be higher salary and easier to get, and the overall better option if I can’t make “taylored food” into a successful startup. 

Pro software development:

But, it is possible to become a software developer with a different academic background. My reasoning is, that when working as a software developer, I would learn things in my 9 to 5 job that would help me with the startup.

Here are my questions:

How specific would my 9 to 5 job have to be, for it to be useful for the development of “taylored food”? 

Do the languages need to be the same? 

Does the 9 to 5 job have to be in web development, or can it be in the development of desktop applications or smartphone applications?

I want to build taylored food with Javascript (frontend and backend) and a smidge of python.

How valuable do you think the learning experience of working as a web developer would be for the development of “taylored food”?

Can I build a minimum viable product of this app just by myself, while working full time as a chemical engineer? I am afraid that building this app in isolation will lead to unconscious incompetence: me writing bad code without knowing I have written bad code. How can I prevent that?

10,azwaje,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/azwaje/jsjquery_getting_referenceerrors_when_trying_to/,[JS][jQuery] Getting ReferenceErrors when trying to create instance of a class loaded via jQuery.getScript(),"Is there something about classes that means they can't be used if loaded via $.getScript(), or am I just a moron? (I accept the latter is likely!)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a number of HTML pages that load jQuery via &lt;script&gt; tags, and then also via &lt;script&gt; tags a small .js file that sets up the \*actual\* JavaScript each page needs to run. This uses jQuery's $.getScript(). The files are loaded sequentially, waiting via callbacks for $.getScript() to finish each time. The files in question mainly comprise a few utility files like text translations and functions common to many pages; the final file to be loaded is the actual one containing code dedicated to running the page. Once this loads, the page comes alive, as it were.

&amp;#x200B;

This final file will contain JavaScript that calls upon variables and functions present in the other files. This system has been running perfectly well right up until I started messing with classes, at which point it endured a sliding faceplant into coarse gravel! 

&amp;#x200B;

I've found that while variables and functions can be referenced just fine, classes cannot, and any attempt to use them results in a ReferenceError (not defined). However, if I load the file that contains them via &lt;script&gt; tags; then they work as expected.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, is there something about JavaScript classes that means, if you $.getScript() the file, they are not evaluated? This does not appear to be because of namespacing (I can access everything else) and is not a race condition or issue with the async nature of $.getScript() since the code that uses the loaded classes runs last (I can also load in an affected file manually via the console in DevTools, and still be unable to access anything but its functions and variables, no classes).

&amp;#x200B;

If I make a function inside one of these files that references/instantiates a class also within that file, $.getScript() the file, and then run \*that\* function... that works fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I use Javascript to create a new &lt;script&gt; element, then set the same file as its src attribute, then append that as a child of the page body, then I can reference the class just fine too (but as far as I can tell I lose the ability to have a callback run when the file has finished loading)

&amp;#x200B;

What's going on here? How come everything but classes is accessible via $.getScript()?

&amp;#x200B;

Help much appreciated, I feel like I'm missing something fundamental here which everyone else knows by default because this is NOT talked about anywhere on the web that I have found so far.

# Approach 1 (save Image when conditions are met):

    dialog(""save image?"");
    if (answer == yes) {
      if (fileExists) {
        dialog(""override file?"");

probbaly the easiest one to read, but: I'm calling saveImage() twice and if i would add more conditions, it would become very nested

&amp;#x200B;

# Approach 2 (stop if any conddition isnt met; saveImage at the end):

    dialog(""save image?"");
    if (answer == no) {
      return;
    }
    if (fileExists) {
      dialog(""override file?"");
      if (answer == no) {
        return;
      }
    }
    saveImage();
    

looks less bulky, but worse readability using return statements in my opinion

# Approach 3 (saveImage is part else-block [when user wants to save the Image]):

&amp;#x200B;

    dialog(""save image?"");
    if (answer == no) {
      return;
    } else {
      if (fileExists) {
        dialog(""override file?"");
        if (answer == no) {
          return;
        }
      }
      saveImage();
    }
    

additional else makes it more clear that saveImage is only called when the first dialog is corfirmed

# Approach 4 (Mixture/best of both worlds?)

    dialog(""save image?"");
    if (answer == yes) {
      if (fileExists) {
        dialog(""override file?"");
        if (answer == no) {
          return;
        }
      }
      saveImage();
    }
    

has the benefit of approach 3 while loking less bulky

So if you have not read through how to get a value from url then [click here to read](https://www.superguideblog.com/2019/03/how-to-get-value-from-url-using-php-programming-language.html).So now I hope you know all about getting value from link. The next thing is to make your like-table. The like\_table carry the following rows, like\_id, user\_id and post\_id.

29,b26kyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/b26kyj/what_is_your_approach_to_handling_different/,What is your approach to handling different development environments?,"Currently, I mostly use a traditional workflow (and sometimes Vagrant). I install all project dependencies on my machine. It gets ugly when I'm working on multiple projects at the same time. You end up with issues such as trying to get MariaDB and MySQL to co-exist. Over time, there will be ghost configuration files sitting around.

Here's my best, though likely biased, conception of pros/cons of different workflows. I'm interested in hearing the community's thoughts.

- Traditional : Can become management hell, has best performance.
- Docker : Limited to ~~Linux-based~~ host-os based containers, performance better than VMs, reproducible (can have weird kernel-land issues).
- Vagrant : Can use a variety of environments (FreeBSD, Windows), performance penalty, reproducible.
- PXE &amp; Network Booting : Annoying to make .ISOs for each environment, performance good (completely native).
- Qubes :  immature and more geared towards security, dependent on hardware supported by Xen hypervisor, limited supported operating systems.

Thinking about this problem a bit more, unit tests are not a replacement for a debugger. But, the debugger is often tightly integrated to the IDE. It seems like there's not really an easy way to run your IDE debugger in a container or VM. I feel that the Qubes and PXE approaches could allow for reproducible environments with use of a GUI. However, Qubes and PXE seem a lot more exotic than having disposable containers or VMs.",8,2,2019-03-17 11:58:35

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to create a browser based trivia game.  The trivia players will be using a mobile device (tablet) to access the game.

&amp;#x200B;

For the trivia game, I want a master device.  The master is responsible for sending the trivia question and multiple choice responses to each device at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

Each tablet has 4 touch activated multiple choice buttons.  The user will select an answer and be locked into that answer without being able to change.  Once all the answers are received the team name and selections will appear on screen in descending order of quickness.

&amp;#x200B;

I already started a concept for this game and have a working example in PHP/MySQL.  **I feel like this is the wrong approach, perhaps you can advise**.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is the game isn't very efficient.  It relies on a high frequency setInterval function (runs on a  &lt;1 second loop until question is sent) to ping the database for the new question and multiple choice answers.  Since speed is a factor in this game If I have more than 12 players, I begin to overload the db and run out of available sockets.",13,2,2019-03-17 12:05:52

The cache backend is redis. For a given product the factors that influence the price are:

1. sku
2.  channel
3. sub channel
4. plan
5. date

Currently the cache is structured like this in redis: 

    product1_channel1_subchannel1:  {sku_1:  {plan1: {2019-03-18: 2000}}}

The API caters to requests for multiple products, skus and all the factors above . So they decided to query all the data on a product\_channel\_subchannel level and filter the data in the app which is very slow. Also they have decided that, on a cache miss they will construct the cache for all skus for 90 days of data. This way only one request will face the wrath while the others gets benefited from it (only the catch is now we are busting cache more often which is also dragging the system down)

The downside of going with all these factors included in the keys is there will be too many keys. To ball park there are 400 products each made up of 20 skus with 20 channels, 200 subchannels 3 types of plans and 400 days of pricing. To avoid these many keys at some place we must group the data.

The system is currently receives about 10 rps and the has to respond within 100ms.

&amp;#x200B;

Question is:

1. Is the above cache structure fine? Or how do we go about flattening this structure?
2. How are caches stored in pricing systems in general. I feel like this a very trivial task nonetheless I find it very hard to justify my approaches
3. Is it okay to sacrifice one request to warm cache for bulk of the data? Or is it better to have a cache warming strategy?

I did not take SSR (Server-side rendering) into account until we were well along in the build process. SSR is important strictly for SEO purposes.

At the moment, all of our routes are being done in ReactJS on the front-end, along with the rest of the website. The only thing we are using Symfony for is to make a call to the Directus CMS API to grab our data/content. We are also just specifying all of the routes in annotations in the Symfony controller, which allows us the deep link to that route.

What would be the best process to implement SSR rendering since everything is currently happening in the front-end? Does it make sense to stay on Symfony?",1,1,2019-03-17 17:52:59

&amp;#x200B;

Currently working on a black jack project, and i got the logic working. Now, I want to create images of the current table situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine having a black jack table picture, and a bunch of card-pictures. I want to edit these cards onto/ontop of the black jack table picture. 

&amp;#x200B;

So let's say the logic says player has Diamond 10, Clubs 5.  Dealer has .. Hearts of 4 and a hidden card.

I then want to generate a  Diamond 10 and a Clubs of 5 at a pre-determined position. Also generate the dealers' cards at a specified location ontop of the table image. 

&amp;#x200B;

If there is a way to load the image into a 2D array of pixels, i would simply want to run a double for - loop and replace some given pixels in the table picture  with the card' pixels. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice? thanks in advance (: ",1,1,2019-03-08 10:40:56

I was wondering if there is a way to see if the mouse is pressed when hovering over a panel of the grid so it can then be colored.

Link provided shows how our game looks like atm. I want it to color the panes as I click and drag over them.

Now games are written in a plethora of languages, disregarding assembly, which is fine. However, like systems back in the day, your console would still have a display when turned on before the game would load (on the dreamcast, for example, it asks you for your time, and gives a menu to scroll through. The gamecube, wii, and many other systems have this in place). So my question is what assembly language does the ps3 use? What CPU was used? What language is used to create the menu, animations, and other such things? Thanks for answering if you can, I'd appreciate it",5,1,2019-03-08 12:36:07

I've programmed in C++ for a while now using lots of OOP, but I want to start to try and move away from using so many classes. How would I get started in thinking in a more procedural way (right now my brain comes up with very object-oriented approaches for things).

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I've made a few very small games and they've all been set out with a Game class, with Player and Enemy and Tile etc. being other classes instantiated from Game. How would a game that uses more procedural code be set out?

I have a function,  `constexpr uint64_t get_magic_number();` from which I call `const auto magic_number = uint64_t get_magic_number();`

I have tested this for all `key`s, and it retrieves the correct `value`.

`magic_number` is clamoring to be constexpr but I get the error message:

Is there a way to change the compiler step size in Xcode?

I'm looking to add some debugging functionality. Ideally this will be in the form of a console window which outputs where the code currently is (class and method name) as a user navigates through and interacts with the application's GUI. I'd need to be able to isolate this to a specific package so as to avoid spam of native java output.


My main question is, is this possible? My understanding is the JVM is closed off but there are ways to interact with it by attaching things such as additional .jar files to it via command line arguments. This could contain an application that monitors for certain things and could provide output? I've also found stuff about the JNI however I'm still trying to get my head around how that works and whether or not it is appropriate for what I'm trying to achieve.",0,1,2019-03-16 09:33:14

However, i am doing a problem set from [Rosalind.info](https://Rosalind.info) and the question says

&amp;#x200B;

## Problem

The problem is to find a given set of keys in a given array.

**Given:** Two positive integers n≤10\^5n≤10\^5 and m≤10\^5m≤10\^5, a sorted [**array**](http://rosalind.info/glossary/algo-array/) A\[1..n\]A\[1..n\] of integers from −10\^5 to 10\^5 and a list of m integers −10\^5≤k1,k2,…,km≤10\^5−10\^5≤k1,k2,…,km≤10\^5.

**Return:** For each kiki, output an index 1≤j≤n1≤j≤n s.t. A\[j\]=kiA\[j\]=ki or ""-1"" if there is no such index.

## Sample Dataset

**5**

**6**

**10 20 30 40 50**

**40 10 35 15 40 20**

## Sample Output

**4 1 -1 -1 4 2**

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that a binary search basically will take the list A\[1...n\] and a value to search for k. it will take A\[n/2\] and check it against k, if it is bigger than k it will recurse the upper half of the list, if it is lower than k it will recurse the bottom half and will keep doing this until it finds the value in the list.

&amp;#x200B;

From looking at the sample dataset, i understand that the bottom list 'm' is being compared to the top list and returning the index location. what i dont understand is what the purpose of the 5 and 6 are. They seem to be the length of the two lists, but is that necessary in the code?

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate any help. I would have post this on Stackoverflow but i am trying to get to 15 rep and this seems like a question that the group would downvote to hell, considering they did one of my questions that i posted asking about why my output on a program i wrote was wrong.

A little hand holding via a good tutorial and/or something easier to roll out would be nice. I'd like something public facing on whatever makes life easy and secure (I can pay if it helps the setup).

I want the output of the macro to change depending on if the key is being clicked once, or being held down for long. If it's pressed once and released I want to run a macro with a 500 millisecond delay in it and multiple key presses. If it's being held down for longer than those previous 500 ms, I want to keep one of the buttons down. In a game I pretty much want to do a dodge maneuver (Shift button plus Left button) to the left when initially pressing 'A' (WASD layout), but keep the left arrow key down as long as I press 'A' after the initial dodge.

The pseudo-code would look something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

If key pressed down (A) then

Press down (Left and Shift)

Wait 500 milliseconds

Release only (Shift) to stop dodging

If key released (A) or if another button is pressed

Release (Left and Shift) and exit the macro",2,1,2019-03-13 21:56:47

Recently, I got the itch to learn how to program and switch careers. There seems to be something in the air that this has started to kick up into the mainstream. I'm only about 6 weeks into my journey and I have noticed a few things right off the bat. These are some thoughts I have, just curious on your experience as well.

The various languages and framworks seem to carry the same concepts? What I mean is that if I have a problem, and I need to solve that problem most concepts are similar in their approach to solving that problem but the syntax is different. I hope that made sense. 

And I feel about a week ago I started to get it, the idea of programming and thinking like a programmer. The first two weeks I was stuck in this mindset of what language should I learn, what courses are the best and all that junk. I narrowed down more specifically to the job I am interested in and that changed everything. And recently, I can look at code and seem to understand what I am trying to achieve. Does this continue to grow?

Also - at what point do I need to start creating and move on from courses? I am fairly quick at learning, and sitting for long hours isn't an issue. But I am a believer of sink or swim, so is this question and bit more subjective towards what I am seeking to build?

Anyways - wanted to start a dialogue for my own journey and others. Looking to create a database of knowledge.

I'm having a problem with a simple app I'm developing. So I have a listbox that has the letters A-F representing student grades. When I iterate through an arraylist of data, if the grade selected in the listbox is equal to the element in the arraylist, I want to display the previous element because that displays the name of the person associated with the grade. This is because the arraylist is formatted like [""Heather"",""A"",""Brian"",""C"",""Jose"",""A""]. I've been trying for a little bit but I can only get to the point where the same name is repeated in the textbox for every instance of a particular letter grade. For instance in the example I gave above I would be getting two occurrences of Heather in the textbox instead of Heather and Jose. I see that as a plus because the iteration is clearly working fine but there's just some small issue in there that I can't for the life of me figure out.

This project has quite a few modules that are focused on fetching, cleaning, and transforming data.

One issue that I have come across over and over is where to put the ""source of truth"" and how to translate this into objects within my program. So far, due to my incompetence, this has ended up with duplication and all kinds of nasty cascading issues whenever changes occur.

In particular, for reasons of speed, a few modules are located in Java. This code made requests directly to the DB (which is the current ""source of truth"" about data objects) and  ended up with a ton of domain model-type code that was replicated elsewhere in the project. 

I am using an ORM which auto-generates this code so it isn't a total nightmare (i.e. most changes just required running the code generator again) but I am also slightly suspicious of ORMs and cautious that any changes in the future or having to work in a language that won't auto-generate objects will derail things. Ideally I want to remove all the domain model-ish code, remove all the dependencies on unrelated stuff, and just have these modules during pure transformations.

My first step has been to remove all the DB code/SQL statements from these modules and move into the main API...but, of course, now these modules are just receiving untyped JSON with all the chaos that entails (and I am worried that I am about to do something unwise that I don't understand).

&amp;#x200B;

I hadn't written, learnt or so much as looked at a line of code until about 18 months ago where I landed myself an apprenticeship taking me into a FE developer role using Angular JS then Angular 6, I was always relatively techy and this line of work seemed right up my street and it is, I love the challenging aspects it has in regards to the need to problem solve, the ability to write clean effective code and the fact that at least on a FE perspective I get to create something that I can actually see the end result off I mean just wow that ability at your finger tips is such a rewarding experience.

&amp;#x200B;

There is one huge issue at the moment though that is nearly driving me away from the career and that's in the company I work for there is a strong drive to deliver features in a 7-8 days basis by meeting the MVP to ""please"" a board of investors/Po's and so forth, rather than delivering a product that is written well and to a high quality as it's all about faking a finished product &amp; smoke and mirrors which in itself leads to a huge amount of unnecessary tech debt in my eyes..  followed by the other issue that we have a fixed price contractual backlog on an Agile project where the contractual backlog doesn't even meet what the end users are expecting in various aspects - I should note this is no small time company they make hundreds of millions.... Which is what has irked me a little that such a successfully company  seems to run it's project (or at least the one I'm on) so badly. 

&amp;#x200B;

This constant need to push relatively high quantities of features out, not really fit for purpose amassing tech debt with a relatively toxic work environment is really killing the spark this career flared in me while for the first time in my life exposing me to relatively constant levels of mental stress and I want to change that.  


Which leads me onto my main question, and someone in my position who is obviously still a tadpole in the grand scheme of things with a lot to learn and a desire to be taught to better hone my skills, what advice could be given as to where I should aim to take my career once I finish my apprenticeship, as in what kind of product am I going to produce, what methodologies to they use, do they focus on quality not quantity or at the very least an acceptable balance of both, while providing a enriching environment to learn?

&amp;#x200B;

This might seem like an absurd question like surely something like this doesn't exists, but a point in the right direction to meeting some of those requirements would be greatly appreciated, hopefully this hasn't been a tedious read for those of who have read it but I look forward to your responses.

Getting a crash and Thread:1 Signal SIGBART.,"I am making an app on Xcode and using the single view app version as it's all I have used so far. In the app there are multiple views and clicking on a button will progress to the next view. I want information from my first view such as an input that has been entered into my textfield to go to a label in my 4th view. The button btw goes to the second view. To do this I am using  

**override** **func** prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: **Any**?) {

**let** nvc = segue.destination **as**! ViewController

**let** firstQuestionAnswerPageOne = nvc.firstQuestionVariable

answerPageFirstQuestion.text = firstQuestionAnswerPageOne

}

&amp;#x200B;

So firstQuestionVariable is the text input of the textfield and I make a variable in my 4th view equal that. Then I make the label equal that variable. The only problem is that it does not transfer the data and if I click the button to go from 4th view to fifth  my Xcode project crashes with Thread:1 Signal SIGBART and is highlighting

 

**let** nvc = segue.destination **as**! ViewController

&amp;#x200B;

line of code and in the console this error pops up...

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Could not cast value of type 'singleSelfApp.secondAnswerViewController' (0x1090d4670) to 'singleSelfApp.ViewController' (0x1090d4518).**

I don't know exactly where to post my question so please feel free to direct me somewhere else if you think of a better sub.

Thought I'd ask here as a techie mind will be better suited.

I'm trying to do the following: out of a list of posts in a localethereum.com, I want to detect new people who post. The reason for that is I talk to all of them but I might forget who I already talked to, so I'd need to extract whoever's new there.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my trivial approach — but it's trivial and I think a more intelligent mind can come up with a better solution:

Copy-paste all posts in an Excel spreadsheet

""Clean"" i.e. delete everything except username

Compare it to a list of all-time people I've spoken to and see who's not there

Repeat this every day.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I'd be looking for an alert? Also, ppl on [localethereum.com](https://localethereum.com) enable and disable their listing here and there, so my trivial approach wouldn't counter that

190,aw7dak,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/aw7dak/redis_hitting_max_connections_with_clients/,Redis hitting max connections with clients issuing info command,"I tried posting this in /r/redis, but my post was auto-removed.

We're having an issue hitting the max number of clients immediately after starting redis. When issuing a MONITOR command, we see thousands of INFO commands issued from our master server.


It seems to be baselining around 9000 connections most of the time. This will occasionally drop to a more normal value for our server for a couple of seconds, then it will immediately spike back to the ~9000 connections.


Anytime redis gets busy during the normal business day, we are hitting our max connections and our services start failing.

When I run the MONITOR command, this is a sample of what I see.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been having a number of extremely frustrating issues the past few days, which I have been round and round google trying to solve, tried all sorts of things to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem 1)

I can't import pygame in Idle with the error: 

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygame' - even though it is definitely installed, as in terminal, if I ask pip3 to install pygame it says:

Requirement already satisfied: pygame in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (1.9.4)

I think there may be a problem with several conflicting versions of python on my computer, as when i type sys.path in Idle (which by the way displays Python 3.7.2 ) the following are listed:

'/Users/myname/Documents', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python37.zip', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload', '/Users/myname/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages'

So am I right in thinking pygame is in the python3.7/sitepackages version, and this is why idle won't import it? I don't know I'm just trying to make sense of this. I have absoloutely no clue how to solve this,""re-set the path"" or whatever. I don't even know how to remove unnecessary versions of python.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem 2) 

Apparently there should be a python 2.7 system version installed on every mac system which is vital to the running of python regardless of the developing environment you use. Yet all of my versions of python seem to be in the library/downloaded versions. Does this mean my system version of python is gone? I have put the computer in recovery mode today and done a reinstall of the macOS mojave system today, so shouldn't any possible lost version of python 2.7 be back on the system now?

&amp;#x200B;

Problem 3)

When I go to terminal, frequently every command I type is 'not found'.

I have sometimes found a temporary solution is typing:

export PATH=""/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin""

but the problems always return!!!

As I say I also did a system reinstall today but that has helped none!!

&amp;#x200B;

Can anybody please help me with these queries? I am really at the end of my tether and quite lost, forgive my programming ignorance please. Many thanks.",11,1,2019-03-01 16:37:36

I am going in for my 3rd interview, that will be a 2 hour in person technical assignment with their lead developer.

It sounds like it will be a combination of solving problems/debugging code on my computer, and also answering questions verbally. It is more of an interactive assignment with their lead than a sit down and do it yourself.

I by no means consider myself an amazing developer, but I do get the job done when I am handed a task. I am not someone that remembers the syntax for everything, and often find myself doing a quick search on the web for the syntax.

How do you handle and prepare for these interviews? Are there any cool tools online you have used? Blog posts? Books?

This is for a full-stack web developer position.",8,18,2019-03-01 17:38:15

Not concerned about learning languages, there are lots of resources for that.  I need help with **big-picture understanding** of what's going on in a computer, and the terminology associated with it.  Like, what's a ""web backend""?  Or a ""markup language""?
