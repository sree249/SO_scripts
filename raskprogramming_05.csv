(same implementation in both JS and Racket)

It works great, and does exactly what the Y combinator is supposed to do (implement recursion without calling a function inside of its own definition). Yet, it's structure is totally different from the 'standard' looking implementation, viz,

`var Y = f =&gt; (x =&gt; x(x))(y =&gt; f(x =&gt; y(y)(x)));` 

`var fac = Y(f =&gt; n =&gt; n &gt; 1 ? n * f(n-1) : 1);`

I am working on a project with an ""Order"" table. The Order has mostly fields you would typically find in an Order schema (product info, customer info, contact info etc...). There are also two other tables called ""OrderStop"" and ""OrderUpdate"" which have Many to One relation to Order (An Order Stop is basically an address/date/time, an Order Update are text updates for an order. An Order can have many stops and updates).

The Orders table will be queried quite a lot as checking the status of Open Orders is a core use case to the system. So my question is this. When an Order is Complete / Finished. Which of these two options would be better in terms of performance?

1. Move the Order to a new table called ""Completed Orders"" , to keep the Order table optimized and smaller for only active orders which will be queried more. I assume the OrderStop and OrderUpdates would either need to also be copied to new tables, or serialized to JSON as a field in Completed Orders

`SELECT * FROM completed_order WHERE ?`

1. Introduce an indexed bool column like ""isClosed"" to the existing Order Table?

`SELECT * FROM order WHERE isClosed = FALSE`

So basically would it be better to query a different table for Completed Orders? Or just add a where not closed to the existing queries to only get Orders not Closed.",2,2,2019-05-17 13:38:31

I need some clarification on a few parts of the article, I hope someone here is knowledgable on the topic.

So, you have to inject the DLL by using `openprocess` and `writememory`, correct? After that, do you have to use `LoadLibrary` as well? Or do you use **asm** inlined in the .exe to call `LoadLibrary`? 

If it's the latter (inlined asm), i don't see how exactly it would be done, because you only want to do `LoadLibrary` once, after that, you just want to `call`, in **asm**, the dll.

Or, if you do `LoadLibrary` from the loader (externally with `createremotethread` then I'm a bit confused on the difference between code caves and dll injection. Because whenever I read about different hacking techniques, it's always a choice between using dll injection or using code cave, or some other technique such as manual mapping or reflective dll injection and etc. Why does this article use both code cave and dll injection?

35,bq9huk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/bq9huk/good_way_to_consider_corner_cases/,Good way to consider corner cases,"Hello r/AskProgramming,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for some advice/suggestions on how I can consider corner-cases quicker and more clearly. I was working on this LeetCode problem:

&gt;Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence)

&amp;#x200B;

and found it took me a long time to get to a working solution. In the end, I did take a look at hints in the discussion area.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try my best to describe what I think my weakness is by contrasting it with a type of problem I'm rather good at. So problems that I'm good at are problems where the number of corner cases are small, for example:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Given a BST and a target of type int, return it's in-order traversal predecessor and successor.
2. Given a binary tree - return true if it's a BST otherwise return false

I'm good with these types of problems because I can narrow down the corner cases (and maybe minimize them). I just walk the tree, if I run into a null I do X and if I run into a valid node I do Y. The problem I have with the LeetCode problem is the number of possible input permutations are large so it's harder to consider all corner cases. Possible inputs like:

1. 1,2,3,4
2. 1,2,3,3,4
3. 3,1,2,3,3,4
4. 4,4,4,4,4
5. \[\]
6. etc

The input can be any length and the numbers can be increasing, decreasing, stay the same.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was solving the LeetCode problem I knew it was going to require a DP solution at first glance. I also knew how to get the longest increasing sub-sequence and felt this was just a slight modification of that problem. I tried a number of approaches before taking a hint and coming to the final solution.

1. Approach 1 - works for input \[1,3,5,4,7\] but failed for \[1,2,3,3,4\]
2. Approach 2 - fixed for approach 1 but fails for \[5,5,5,5,5\]
3. Approach 3 - fixed for approach 1&amp;2 but fails for \[1,2,3,1,2,3\]

Let me know if you want details on each approach but I hope my point is clear - the possible permutations of input is vast it's hard for me to consider all corner cases. It also wasn't obvious to me that I needed to tabulate the number of LIS I've seen so far not just the longest lengths, but I think I can fix this problem with more practice. My biggest problem seem to be difficulty considering large patterns of inputs.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I did try out various inputs on pen&amp;paper but couldn't cover all possible inputs hence my problem.",3,5,2019-05-18 18:11:15
36,bqa0kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/bqa0kh/easy_and_simple_git_gui_clients_for_linux/,Easy and simple git GUI clients for Linux?,"I am working in a project where very experienced developers, less experienced developers, and engineers from other disciplines work together, and am setting up a shared workstation where will use git for revision management and also configuration control. This is essentially laboratory software. Engineers will be able to change the configuration and they will not have the time to learn all of git. Some of the younger developers know only subversion well, and they are, say, a bit intimidated by the complexity of git. After setting up the base system with Ubuntu, I had therefore the thought it might be nice to include an easy-to-use git tool.

I am using git myself since a long time. Most of the time, I was using the command line. Recently, I have switched to using Magit for all code editing tasks. I find it fantastic because it makes it very convenient to select diff chunks to split commits into subsets, and if necessary amend and squash local commits before merging them. However, I'd say it is not exactly beginner-friendly (as in, ""quick to learn""). I am also occasionally using gitk when solving complex bugs or merge conflicts. But as I am lazy, that does not happen too often, we are in the comfortable situation that we can almost always organize work in a way that avoids such conflicts. An other viewer that I like a lot is ""tig"", which is a console repository browser. As one might expect, it is very fast and can easily be used in a remote terminal. In the sense used above, it is not ""beginner-friendly"" either.

I thought there might be easier GUI clients which are more accessible, so I had a look what is on the market. I already knew ""git gui"", which I think is quite OK for committing changes, and simple enough. For [alternatives, I found](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools#Graphical_Interfaces_-_FLOSS) (and looked into): 

giggle, gitg, git-colab

I did not look into IDEs and huge commercial apps. Partly because I just hate them, and partly because the developers are already using their respective tool of choice, they are not going to switch.

My impression is that the viable variants mostly split tasks into committing a set of changes, with a simple interface, and viewing a commit graph, in the same way as tasks are divided between git gui and gitk. I think this makes sense because for an active task, like committing code,  one wants an interface which allows to focus as much as possible on the change to make, while for a browsing task, one wants to have a lot of information easily accessible.

I found gitg a nice variant of gitk, it has a bit less functionality but might be OK. 

For ""git gui"" - like applications, I found nothing that convinced me. For example, the giggle version I looked into does not allow to check out another branch, so it does not allow to make or initiate a merge. This is easily possible with git gui. Also, giggle conflates a bit the concept of history browsing and committing changes. I was even less satisfied with git-colab. 

What I miss is not so much that one cannot do everything possible but that basic functionality is not there or not easy to access. For example, I do not think that merging branches is a too advanced concept, as in many work flows, a developer should split changes into small orthogonal feature branches.

I think an easy GUI should support these functionalities:
- add files to staging
- ideally, add selected hunks (section of changes) to the staging area
- view diff of changes both in relation to latest commit and to another branch (e.g. the master)
- commit changed files
- possibly, have the option to amend a commit
- create branches
- check out branches
- merge branches
- launch a merge tool or editor of choice if there is any merge conflict

So, did I oversee something? Are there beginner-friendly, not overwhelmingly detailed, easy-to use GUI git clients for Linux? (I am not asking for huge, IDE-like proprietary programs which do not have a FOSS license.)

After a week I finish school. Since the summer, I want to start intensively studying programming and looking for work.

I found myself at a fork in the road.

The fact is that I chose WEB for my career. It's easier to get there, easier to study, etc.

At the same time, I have vision problems, for this reason, Frontend is not interesting for me, and I don’t have to be a Fullstac developer either.

For this reason, I focus on Backend.

Some time ago, choosing between PHP and Python for programming web applications, I made a choice in favor of Python. A developing programming language, it is possible to do not only the web, but I was also interested in artificial intelligence.

Now I understand that it’s not very comfortable for me to work with Python in terms of web applications.

Where the templates begin, I have not become friends with Django.

I understand that in PHP there are also necessary frameworks, but with the help of PHP I can program without frameworks.

In the future, I'd like to organize an IT business related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, plus a web programming.

But which way to choose at this stage?

I understand that if I choose PHP, I will still continue to learn Python.

So what is the focus now, if I choose a language to work as a programmer?

PHP is more popular in my country.

These objects are made up of different classes but inherit from a single class. The states of these objects need to be synced between the two processes.

I've chosen file mappings as my method of IPC, which I believe is sound, though correct me if I'm wrong. My main problem at this point is the actual synchronization process and all of the problems and design questions that brings. This needs to run as quickly as possible, with the least amount of overhead possible. I'm wondering if there are any libraries that will simplify this process or if I have to do everything myself. I've heard of COM but am not familiar with it, would that be applicable here and make my life easier, or is that antiquated at this point?

I actually have this tree serializable to a file via protobuf on the C# end, but I need to be able to write and read from these objects on the fly, and have it be fully synchronized. Serialization and deserialization is too costly. I'm also wary of race issues.

Some extra details about the project:

* The executable is initialized first and is the primary maintainer of the tree
* Though I'm not sure how much memory the tree could end up using when the application is in use by an actual user, I'm predicting a very large tree of objects with a fair amount of memory overhead to be frequent, assuming no optimizations are made later. This is the primary reason I went for a file mapping for the IPC, rather than pipe-messaging, though if you believe a pipe would still be better let me know.

I'm looking for any design ideas, examples of similar implementations to this problem, or libraries that might assist with this. If there are any more details about the project that would be useful knowing in answering my questions, let me know. Thanks in advance.",2,3,2019-05-29 22:06:00

I'd like simulate things such as birth/death/mutations of artificial organisms using math (easy to do in any programming language) but I'd also like to have a way to render these organisms in 3D using custom models and what not.

I've heard Blender has some python hooks, but I was wondering if there's any pure python libraries that I could just import and run along with? My experience with blender is limited, but I'm willing to learn if that's truly the best option...

I'm also open to suggestions on other languages/3d solutions, but I'd prefer the easiness and quickness of Python development...

Also, if this isn't where to ask the question, I'm also open to directions",0,1,2019-05-30 04:33:30

    /* snipped */

How do I interpret the middle call to `futex`? Namely, there are a few things I don't understand:

* what is going on with the fourth argument? According to `futex(2)` in the manual, the prototype is 
 
          int futex(int *uaddr, int futex_op, int val,
                     const struct timespec *timeout,   /* or: uint32_t val2 */
                     int *uaddr2, int val3);
  however, I don't see how this has type *timespec.
* In my version of the manual, the futex_op FUTEX_WAIT_PRIVATE is not described. 

I'm running Arch Linux, and `strace` version 5.0.

EDIT: for context, what's happening is basically [this](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-core/issues/3277) problem. I was looking at the system trace hoping to gain some information. The reason I did this is because for some reason, the error message is displayed on my terminal, despite not being written to stdout or stderr. But in order to understand why, I think I need to understand this `futex` syscall.",0,3,2019-05-30 05:07:50

I'm looking for a way to save coding patterns and commands (mainly in python and related libraries) alongside some comments and easily be able to search through them (maybe adding some tags for quick search). Syntax highlighting would be a nice plus to have.

I am currently considering jupyter notebooks and github gists. At the moment I am more biased towards the former, but I'm open to suggestions!.

Any feedback or experience is greatly appreciated!

The intended use is for a print-on-demand web app.

I've done some googling, but came up empty handed.

I was hoping for a robust solution along the lines of webkit filters, css blend modes, or even server-side dlls, or cloud solutions like Azure's Computer Vision (which does have some neat image processing but doesn't offer auto-adjust as such).

I'm a product manager, so my tech knowledge is limited; maybe I'm missing something obvious? Or is the most probable way forward through github, scouring for smaller projects and hoping for the best?",6,3,2019-05-30 07:11:00

For my website if I purchased a domain from a different source could I do something that would allow me to use the domain with firebase to host the website instead of using the hosting service the original domain provider has?

At my internship I have a handful of tasks, one of which is to prepare a spreadsheet in a particular format by adapting one I pull from a company portal site.

Normally I have to click on the type of query I want, type a range of dates and which project I’m accessing, and hit enter. At this point, a customizable spreadsheet appears with rows and columns depending on what pieces of information you’re interested in. You can drag and drop rows and columns on and off the spreadsheet. Normally I drag four query rows off and then add two rows. Then I would click the “export to excel 2000” button and make sure to save as an excel file rather than a webpage.

I have to do this multiple times a month, and it takes a while because the site is slow. It’d be real convenient for myself (and would probably make me beloved by company managers everywhere in the company who are forced to use this obnoxious system) if I could automate this process. I’m not a CS whiz, so Please bear with me. My questions are as follows:

-This is a company site. Would trying to access data in an automated fashion make it look like someone was trying to steal proprietary data?

-This May be a sort of application/website combo. It seems to be run through a different application than explorer- some company portal that I had to get special permission to access. Does that make this harder?

-Is there some way to program the location of my data entry and geography of my mouse clicks/drags/drops such that a program/macro navigates the webpage as I would in person, or will need a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of the site to do this?

While his trading program works well when he is at home, the program lacks features for sending alerts when he is away from home. We have been brainstorming at possible solutions and would love to hear if anyone has a better idea than us (we don't have many).

The problem: when he steps out of his home, he is unable to hear his computer sound alerts when a specific event happens (price level is reached, stop loss, etc). We would need to somehow receive an alert to his phone (sms? email? app notification?) relatively quickly (ideally under 15 seconds).

Ideas: we had several ideas but not too many good ones... we thought of having a walkie talkie next to the microphone, having a call going between two phones while he is away, having a noise alert hardware (we saw one called NoiseAware),... None of these solutions seemed very good, some pricey and some not very feasable.

Question: I always like to go the programming route if possible, so do you guys think its feasable to program for example something when a noise happens (either loud enough or the alert specific noise) we can somehow get a quick notification on a different device? If it's possible, if you would be so kind to also let us know what would be the best programming language to create something like this so that we can search for a programmer with those skills.

I have whitelist for product codes so I cant type or write anything else into textarea.

Found bad issue, I can write only static product codes like (first 16 is product code other 6 is how many products it is in list...):

&amp;#x200B;

0FAR12345H00123C + 00001P

0FAR54321H00321C + 00001P

0FAR54321H00321C + 00002P

&amp;#x200B;

So now I have two problems..

First problem, whitelist universal product codes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

0FAR12345H00123C + 00001P

0FAR543H00321C + 00001P

0F321H321C + 00001P

0R31H1C + 001P

&amp;#x200B;

Second problem is how to count these product codes under textarea + overall count.

&amp;#x200B;

Example under textarea counts:

0FAR12345H00123C: 5

0FAR543H00321C: 2

0F321H321C: 6

0R31H1C: 4

Overall: 17

&amp;#x200B;

Javascript:

&amp;#x200B;

`""use strict"";`

	`toFile.focus();`

&amp;#x200B;

	`var timeoutId;`

	`$('#toFile').on('keypress', function() {`

`console.log('Textarea Change');`



`clearTimeout(timeoutId);`

`timeoutId = setTimeout(function() {`

`// Runs 3 second (3000 ms) after the last change`    

`saveToFile();`

`}, 3000);`

	`});`

&amp;#x200B;

	`toFile.addEventListener(""keyup"", event =&gt; {`

`const data = toFile.value.split(""\n"");`

`const result = data.unique();`

`info.textContent = result.length !== data.length ? ""Duplicate removed"" : """";`

`toFile.value = result.join('\n');`

	`});`

&amp;#x200B;

	`if (!Array.prototype.unique) {`

`Object.defineProperty(Array.prototype, ""unique"", {`

`configurable: false,  // these 3 properties default to false so not needed`

`enumerable: false,    // But have added them just to show their availability.`

`});`

`v = v.substr(0, v.length - 1);`

`}`

`} else if (!v.substr(16, 22).match(reg)) { // at the moment static 16 product code lenght + 6 is count of products.`

`v = v.substr(0, v.length - 1);`

`}`

`return v;`

`}).join('\n');`

&amp;#x200B;

	  `event.target.value = values;`

	`}`

	

	`function saveToFile() {`

`console.log('Saving to the db');`

`toFile = $('#toFile').val().replace(/\n\r?/g, '&lt;br /&gt;');`

		`$.ajax({`

			`url: ""test2.php"",`

			`type: ""POST"",`

			`data: {toFile:toFile}, // serializes the form's elements.`

			`beforeSend: function(xhr) {`

`// Let them know we are saving`

`$('#status').html('Saving...');`

			`},`

			`success: function(toFile) {`

`// You can get data returned from your ajax call here. ex. jqObj.find('.returned-data').html()`

`// Now show them we saved and when we did`

`var d = new Date();`

`$('#status').html('Saved! Last: ' + d.toLocaleTimeString());`

			`},`

		`});`

	`}`

&amp;#x200B;

	`$('.form').submit(function(e) {`

		`saveToFile();`

		`e.preventDefault();`

	`});`

&amp;#x200B;

HTML:

&amp;#x200B;

`&lt;form class=""contact-form"" method=""post""&gt;`

`&lt;textarea id=""toFile"" name=""toFile"" oninput=""onInput()""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;br&gt;`

`&lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Submit""&gt;`

`&lt;/form&gt;`

&amp;#x200B;

`&lt;!-- under here I want show count of product codes + overall count --&gt;`

&amp;#x200B;

`&lt;div id=""status""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`

`&lt;div id=""info""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`

&amp;#x200B;

This is how I want count product codes and overall:

We are having some challenges with our developer so I'm reaching out to the programming community (those who may know better) about program development.

&amp;#x200B;

We have an application that is branded as ""Enterprise"" level which has a .NET Desktop Application front end with a SQL Database back end.

&amp;#x200B;

The Desktop Application has a text file in its installation folder which contains the path to the SQL environment along with credentials for it. Typically our Developer populates this with ""SA"" credentials for SQL but sometimes it is set to a SQL Account with ""db\_owner"" permissions. How commonly are business applications setup this way?

&amp;#x200B;

There is also a Users table in the SQL Database which contains each users login credentials in clear text along with their individual SMTP information + credentials. How big of a concern should this be treated as?

I need   that  when  I call  that istance (self.pic = pic)  it uploaded  the image of  a dog that I have on my pc (which  it would be the carachter shape of the istance ''Carl'' in the  game)

Do I need to specify ''bark''  and ''move'' function in the class  dog, or can I add  those  functions just to the character ''Carl''  without first putting them into the `def __init __` class dog example: `def __init __` (self, name, sex, age, **pic, move, bark** ) ?

The problem with this module however are two things:

1. If I run this program, an infinite loop happens, which results to a never ending cycle of opened windows.
2. Even without the weird infinite loop problem, if I fixed it with only the first loop in mind, then it'll just display all the windows at once instead of displaying them one by one. Creating confusion within the program.

Is there a way to display the modification windows one by one per row without having to display them all at once?

To put it as simple as possible, I'm building something that makes a specific type of game out of user-made text description files (kinda like inform, if you know that, just much simpler). Think of it as an interpreter. Most of what he, the user, would likely want his game to do can be expressed in those description files, but in case something can't, I'd like to have support for a script language where he'd been given access to a range of functions.  

I'm currently building the prototype in Java (interpreter, not script), but it should be a scripting language that has good interpretation support in general (I plan to make an interpreter in PHP/HTML5/JS as well, for example)

So, is there a scripting language, the easier to understand the better (target users are not programmers, just computer literate), that would be suited for something like this?

Pseudocode of what I'd  like to have in such a script:

    if (actors.status(""angrydude"") == ""scared"") {
        playfield.move(""angrydude"", 300, 450);
        audio.play(""zoidberg_wubwubwub"");

I'm working with a legacy job processing system, in which each task has a concept of smaller steps. This is a multi process system, where steps of a particular task might or might not be executed on the same worker ( all communication is done through Redis ). Imagine the following task , CreateUser, with the following steps:

&amp;#x200B;

\- verify\_registration\_data

\- import\_existing\_data

\- normalize\_imported\_data

\- send\_onboarding\_email

&amp;#x200B;

Those tasks will be executed sequentially, starting with the verify\_registration\_data one, however, in some of the existing tasks, based on some condition, you could jump a few steps. The pattern employed throughout the system is that usually 

the current step of the job will queue execution of the next step, with some arguments, so you could think of it like the output of a specific step in the job plan, becomes the input of the next step.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine that for example step2 might download some data ( let's say a JSON file ) , and add some ""metadata"" fields, and it would need to pass it to the next step in the task. Because job steps might not be executed on the same worker, we usually upload the files to S3, and then the next step in the list will receive a URL which it would need to download. This pattern repeats in many jobs, and it adds up to quite a lot of time spent upload/downloading files.

&amp;#x200B;

I was toying with the idea of perhaps adding some kind of intermediate service and have all uploads/downloads pass through it, and have it running on each of the worker machine, and whenever I upload/download something through this 3rd service, broadcast a message so that all ""cache services"" would grab a copy, which they would keep in RAM, in order to be able to serve it faster. This, however will open up the door to possible race conditions and possibly difficult  cache invalidations. I thought also about saving those files in redis, but it would fill up redis really quick.

I'm a PHP developer and I cannot shake the notion that I'm 'not a proper developer' because that's all I've really known outside a bit of Android development a few years ago. I'm surrounded by people with grounding in C/C++... even Perl, and I feel like they understand the world of development more for it.

My development history starts with Bash, learning the basic constructs and writing text adventure games.

I then started with raw PHP and connecting to databases, and build a laughable but functional e-commerce website from scratch in two weeks without a single line of JavaScript. 

I did some C# and Java programming for game development which I absolutely loved but went nowhere. I had a blast though, but it was only ever squares moving on other squares. I can't draw to save my life.

I moved on to Android development where I built an app that my former workplace then stole to redevelop with a third party for a six figure sum.

I finally took the plunge and went for an entry level service job in IT working with WordPress, rose through the ranks over five years and became the senior developer there.

I am now designing and building APIs and engines in Laravel in a rising company in the telephony sector.

But I still feel like an amateur - I couldn't contribute to Linux, or write a system application. I know only what malloc stands for. 

The answer is learn C or something, but the industry seems to be all over the place! Where do I start to try and learn something not based around a website? What should I do?

I'm trying to code a Tile for my game project that will eventually be incorporated into a double array. My problem lies in the fact that when I instantiate my texture, in this case, a PNG, anywhere other than the `paintComponent()` method and try invoking `g.drawImage()` it won't show up on screen. The curious thing is that when I **do** instantiate the texture inside `paintComponent()` I can print it just fine. Why is this the case?

Part of out process is to take these CV’s and format them into our own company format. The reasons behind this is that clients constantly receive CV’s in a familiar format, creating some brand familiarity. 

We also do this to remove candidate’s private information and unrelated information.

Other reasons are that candidates will sometimes put their oldest work experience first, causing clients to have to scroll to the bottom of the document to find the latest and most relevant experience.

Candidates may also include education before work experience. 
There are a few other reasons we do this.

The problem: This is a lot of admin work and the amount of variation in CV's means I can't think of any possible way that we can automate this process and thus why I am here asking the question.

Is there any way to automate even part of this process to make it faster and cut down on the admin work.

141,bre90c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/bre90c/horrible_coworker/,Horrible co-worker,"I am wondering how you guys feel about this.

I joined a startup about 6 months ago. Basically the team consisted of one front-end and one back-end developer. The front-end developer is sloppy. But the back-end developer is overall very precise in everything he does. He has written a significant amount of integration testing and unit testing.

Although I have noticed if my way of thinking even slightly deviates from his, he goes to publicly humiliate me on the company's group chat channel rather than just talking to me in private about it. Sometimes he just wants me to completely redo things.

If I happen to make a mistake or write a small bug in my code which wasn't covered by a test, he just goes to read my code and tries to find mistakes for the next hour or so, to complain about them in public.

Since we're using Skype and my machine only has 8GB of RAM, I installed the UWP version of Skype, because it uses less RAM, so it basically sits in my system tray. However, if I don't reply within 5 minutes, he goes to complain again. Which is incredibly hard to do if you're being concentrated and working on a second monitor. Then you're often missing the pop ups if any. Sometimes messages don't even come through.

Not to mention 8GB of RAM for Visual Studio 2017 with Resharper is not enough for web development. I'm always hovering around 85% or so when programming. But when I build or run tests, my machine is unresponsive during testing.

Then there is my boss, who promised me a company car, I asked for a budget and was promised a rental car provided when starting. When I started, there was no car, I had to book it myself, and they'd refund me. 6 months later, I am still advancing the rental car. Usually he never replies to e-mails at all. Then tells me I lack communication skills, while I'm continuously giving my team mates or him updates about work being finished.

My boss is also basically obsessed with following every commit or CI build that happens, so even if I don't say anything he will know what is done, despite him not being a programmer.

I've been proactively refactoring code, and rewriting it while working in certain modules for an assignment, then I'm told in my performance reviews that I don't seem to care about anything. I took the job because I wanted to do it, not because of the fact it pays well or has great benefits. I am in fact underpaid and have no benefits. But it's a niche industry, it was that or nothing.

I've made countless suggestions to improve the infrastructure or deployments, but they never seem to care.

On Friday, I fixed a critical bug, I asked if I was allowed to deploy, I was told no. Then on Monday I am insulted for the fact I did not deploy a new version, because of its importance.

Is it time for a change?",12,16,2019-05-21 14:49:43

An example of this is where every node gets a input from every node above it and then comes up with its own output to the entire process but compares it with other nodes in the same layer to decide which is the correct output. This process would continue until it gets through all of the node layers and finally releases with a matrix of outputs from the final node/neural network.

Edit (Pasted comment): Yes, but I’m thinking of it more on in how are brains work. Where neurons can process information individually and then communicate with other neurons to come up with a solution. And then us as individuals bounce ideas off each other to solve issues. See the human race learns collectively on different layers of abstraction. Are neurons process information and then communicate which what’s make us, and then each of us communicate to progress the human race forward. So my question is if we could simulate these layer of abstractions to where eventually the neural net could teach its self by comparing ideas with other neural nets working on the same problem from a different angle?

174,bjehvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/bjehvt/is_javaserverfaces_viable_popular_not/,"Is JavaServerFaces viable, popular, not nearly-completely unknown?","Hi,


I work part-time for a company that has used an old-school Lynx-based terminal for remote data entry for presumably many years, I'm assuming since at least the 80's. It's not great, but worked okay once you figured out how to use it.


Recently they decided to update it to a web-based version, and instantly said everyone has to start using this new version ASAP, with the max time limit to do so being by this weekend.


I finally started using it tonight and I was curious about the `.faces` extension as I've never heard of it, which is kinda weird as I'm a nerd and look up junk about web dev and related languages &amp; technologies which I have no intention of ever using. JSF doesn't seem to be capable of doing anything better than could be done without it, and in fact seems to make many things more difficult just because of bad design decisions.


So, is JSF actually maturing and becoming a reasonable, useful tool, and worth using instead of something like HTML/CSS/JS with modern libraries which easily could've served the same purpose and likely worked far better?


The one good thing I've found so far is the use of MomentJS, but they're even doing that improperly with deprecated methods that throw console messages. They are also using synchronous XMLHTTPRequest for nearly-constant state updates from the server...lol. So, whereas we used to be able to type nearly-constantly and the terminal buffer would allow it to keep up, now we have to wait for it after entering most pieces of data before we can type the next.


The only reason I can consider that they would want it done this way would be to hide much of the possibly-sensitive parts of the server side information, but then I still don't understand why JSF would be an acceptable technology unless they just didn't bother to pay any attention to what was going to be used because they're too lazy, or incompetent, or don't understand programming/technology -- all things that should cause them to be fired, or at least moved to a different job within the company.


Also, dev tools are still perfectly accessible because it's just a webpage that we connect to, so it's not like someone can't just look at the network traffic to easily see the server address without even needing WireShark/etc, along with the page source. So, they're not hiding a whole lot or at least not doing so well, if that was actually the intention.


----


My impression is that they were scammed by a lowest-quote dev who wanted to do an experiment or uses projects like this to extort companies, but they've spent so much they now feel they have to push it, and because of that everyone who uses their data entry system is getting punished.


Pretty sure the turnover rate on this job is about to skyrocket; maybe then they'll consider reverting to the old school way again? Lol.


Edit: this is at least the third time it just ""didn't work"" (sits and spins trying to connect, IDC enough to try to debug it for the idiots) already since we've started using it. That only happened a handful of times over **years** with the legacy system. Modernization my ass; I'm officially considering this a scam or the company trying to take itself out/run off the data entry section of the company by making us deal with this pile of trash.",10,3,2019-05-01 03:45:51

1. Oops, I forgot to write certain code for this, and it's broken
2. Oops, I made a typo/mistake and this is broken
3. I just wrote bad code, this is broken, and this needs to be rethought and redone
4. This is a problem, but the code isn't wrong or bad and changing it would break things, so I'll have to add new code to override/supplement the current code for this type of scenario
5. This edge-case, unusual scenario never came up and is broken, so I'll write new code just for that one situation
6. That isn't exactly a bug, nothing is broken, and this isn't a radical new feature-request, but in retrospect it's really something I should've included from the beginning

&amp;#x200B;

For #6, I'm thinking along the lines of something obvious in retrospect or an appropriate quality of life function, such as supporting ctrl+v in a one-character text area in the event someone needs to paste a character from a different language.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, one of my friends showed me something that he'd built. An email sent to any address on a specific domain (e.g. \`[sam.smith@iownthis.com](mailto:sam.smith@iownthis.com)\` or \`[hiya@iownthis.com](mailto:hiya@iownthis.com)\` or even \`hnetshuoa342323@iownthis.com\`) would be collated into a database.

&amp;#x200B;

This seemed super useful in that you could essentially use the server to get email under any given alias, or to receive 'first-time' discounts multiple times. From what I can gather:

&amp;#x200B;

\- It was written in PHP

\- He clearly owns the domain

\- It may have been using a mail transfer agent

\- It \_may\_ have been running in an EC2 instance

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas on how he might have achieved it? I was gobsmacked.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your time, any and all help is super appreciated!",12,14,2019-05-01 09:47:15
178,bjhohs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/bjhohs/is_there_a_way_to_link_spreadsheet_information/,Is there a way to link spreadsheet information into my HTML file?," 

I have a CSV file with 3 columns and 223 rows. The columns go from items (A column), description (B column), to type (C column). Each row contains information about each item. I want to insert data from all this spreadsheet into my HTML file. Along with this, I want to save time by not copy and pasting 233 sets of information manually.

Originally the information I needed was on a website, however, I found a suggestion to use a webscraper to get all the information I needed. I did this by using python and now I have all the information in the spreadsheet.

The template I would like to follow is shown (using spreadsheet terms). If I were manually doing this the next line of code would look this but with a B instead of an A (A1-&gt;B1)

    &lt;p class=""item-title""&gt;(A1 in spreadsheet)&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p class=""w-itemid""&gt;ItemID: N/A&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226;      (A2 in spreadsheet)&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;ul
    &gt; &lt;p&gt;Type: (A3 in spreadsheet&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Item Pool: N/A&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;/ul&gt;

Another person suggested that I use this code  

    $row = 1;
    $resultArray = [];
    if (($handle = fopen(""relics.csv"", ""r"")) !== FALSE) {
     while (($data = fgetcsv($handle)) !== FALSE) {
         $resultArray[] = $data;
         $row++;
     }     
     fclose($handle); 
    }

 

    if(count($resultArray)&gt;0){
     for($i=0;$i&lt;count($resultArray);$i++){
         echo '&lt;p&gt;Item: '.$resultArray[$i][0].'&lt;/p&gt;';         
        echo '&lt;p&gt;Description: '.$resultArray[$i][1].'&lt;/p&gt;';         
        echo '&lt;p&gt;Type: '.$resultArray[$i][2].'&lt;/p&gt;'; } }

However, I am not too sure how to implement this into my code. I believe this is php, but again I am not too sure how to use this. I have 233 rows in my spreadsheet, so do I put this number in the brackets of $resultArray?

&amp;#x200B;

I want the solution to be able to link the information from my spreadsheet into my HTML without spending an immense amount of time copy and pasting 233 items. I do not mind using Javascript, jQuery, or PHP (but I am still very new to them) as long as it helps me finish this task.",3,1,2019-05-01 10:26:40

I really cannot imagine how this is accomplished. I tried learning Microsoft Macro Assembler and got some things to work but without a proper IDE would not know how to compile and run source code.

No C# experience.,"So, I wrote a little script to retrieve some information from an API we have at work. It searches a txt file containing x number of IDs, and then uses curl to call the API and plugs in the IDs from the text file. I'm using jq to extract a specific part of the JSON into a spreadsheet.

Ultimately, what I'm wanting to do is to write a simple UI that interacts with that same API to extract various fields from the JSON.

My vision is a box for either a single ID, or multiple, and checkboxes for the available fields, that can be checked based on what all is needed. Then, it would dump the data into a spreadsheet with columns for ID, and then whichever fields were extracted.

How easy is this to do for someone with little to no C# experience? I know there is a webrequest class - beyond that, I'm clueless.

Below is the script I wrote which worked beautifully:

    for ID in $(cat IDlist.txt); do echo -n $ID,; curl -s -X GET $(echo ""https://url/api/Retrieve/$ID/DisplayInfo"") -H  ""accept: application/json"" -H  ""ApiKey: apikey"" | jq .field; done &gt; fields.txt",3,1,2019-05-01 15:35:46

Well on my initialize for my purchase tickets button I am getting a null pointer exception error on bold and italics line:

I'm struggling with writing my linked list data structure.  I think my problem is in my add function.  It looks like I'm not managing to reassign the head pointer properly, but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. 

**Add():**

    template&lt;class listType&gt;

        head = newnode;
    
        newnode-&gt;SetNext(head);

But when call the display function (which passes the head to print) from main, the print function always displays the list is empty

**Print Function:**
    
    template&lt;class listType&gt;
     void LinkedList&lt;listType&gt;::Display()
    {
        Print(head);
    }

Few chess positions have as many as 216 moves and so this strategy clogs up the CPU caches with null moves.
