1,ch56dw,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/ch56dw/scientific_teamwork_vs_lone_researchers/,scientific teamwork vs. lone researchers,"I've been doing research in bioinformatics for over 6 years now and I've been in different labs. For most of the time I have been working on my own with loose connections to my supervisor/bosses. And my general impression is that this has been the same for my colleagues as well.

Working alone is like a natural state for me so I am not unhappy about it. But when I read about the backstories of successful scientists and scientific projects, I see that there has been a lot of collaboration and scientific exchanges and brainstorming going on. I hardly see anything like this around me. Only the PIs seem to interact a lot with other PIs and the results do not seem to trickle down to the lower ranks. Collaborations are usually superficial and the PIs coordinate most of the process.

There is also not much scientific discussion going on outside of the mandatory journal clubs/lab reports, because we all have our own research niches and the problems that we try to tackle are so specific, that discussions are usually not possible. However, [rubber-duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) still works, so even one-sided conversations are not completely in vain.

I am curious what the perspective of other people is, especially in other fields. Maybe it is actually rare to find a group of people who just happen to work really well together?",15,10

Hello, I attend a private university in the Boston Area. This past semester I've been dealing with a lot of complex legal issues. My current fear is that some of my rights as a student aren't being respected. When I bring these issues up, I'm told that because they are a private institution they can do whatever they want. However, that's not completely true as they still recieve money from the federal government and are thus bound by certain stipulations. At this point, I think I should try to find a lawyer, but I'm not sure exacty what would be best suited for this situation.

This past semester I submitted two different Title IX complaints against 2 different faculty members. One for an event that occured 2.5 years prior and one for an event that occured a week prior. I submitted them both to the Title IX Coordinator, however, because they involve faculty I had to also report them to the equivalent of HR. I'm later told that these claims will be investigated by a private eye hired by the General Counsel's office and I should expect them to reach out. This was over 2 months ago and I haven't heard anything since despite several requests for updates. As far as I can tell they have no ongoing Title IX investigations.

Additionally, one of the men who I submitted a complaint about kept trying to have meetings with me after I informed his office of my intent to submit a complaint for sexual harassment. I was told that I couldn't refuse to contact him as doing so would be a code of conduct violation given his position at the University.

Any advice as to the type of lawyer I should persue? I would like if they could either work with General Counsel to help alleviate some of the problems or would be willing to work with me to compose a complaint to the Office of Civil Rights. Thank you.",0,0

Most as reference information only, but some with attached PDFs too. It is a free account. I had not had a warning about it exceeding memory limits, or noticed it being so. Then I set aside my account for a while, while I worked on some analyses.

Now I've come back to writing and when I re-entered my Mendeley, I notice that my article count is only about 2000+.

I've contacted Mendeley but so far the response has been truly sluggish (if not stopped completely), with the initial comment being that they can see that I've got the 2000+ papers and they cannot see anything wrong with my account. Very odd, and now unfortunately worrying.

I was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences, and how you overcame it?

&amp;#x200B;

I am a PhD student at UW–Madison who has been suffering from the most severe depression, anxiety, and related imposter syndrome since starting graduate school. I moved across the country from California to work with my advisor here in Madison. I consider myself one of the luckiest people out there because of how supportive my advisor is and how generally cordial my colleagues are in addition to the fact that I am thriving academically, but I still cannot help but to struggle or to feel as if everything that I am accomplishing is for naught. I often liken my scenario to feeling as if I am treading water at times and going nowhere professionally, although I can notice my own progress and achievements in action. Nothing that I ever do is an end in itself. There is always something greater or better that I could be producing in the meantime.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is for those of us who have either left academia or have completed their PhDs and moved on, or those who feel as if they share my experiences. Do these feelings leave after one leaves the academic environment? Is this something that is specific to graduate school?

&amp;#x200B;

I lucked out and landed a non-tenure track job at a local school (where I completed my masters degree and have stayed in touch with half the faculty) and was almost immediately asked to take on our school's new undergraduate analytics program. This is huge for me as analytics is taking over our industry and this could really help my career. While my emphasis wasn't analytics, I have enough background to teach it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have spent the last four or five months very actively developing this new program. I even attended a conference in Chicago two weeks ago. The program starts in August and I was very excited. Meanwhile, they wanted to promote me to visiting assistant professor (still not tenure-track, I know, but I thought getting this program up and running was very important) but in our state all ""new"" positions have to be publicly advertised. The administration said this would in no way affect my fall teaching schedule and as far as they were concerned I was running this program for the next few years.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I got a phone call two days ago. The dean wanted a different candidate to take over my job. Immediately. So I am being let go.

To start, I should say I have not--by any means--had a smooth PhD experience or a good relationship with my supervisor during my 3 years. I have 1-1.5 years left to complete the PhD, which absolutely *can not* come fast enough.

I've tried to focus on going to more conference and meetings since time is running out. I know networking is important. My supervisor and professor have never really encouraged me to go to conferences--everything I've submitted and every conference I've attended has been on my own volition. However, recently my supervisor came to say he submitted an abstract to a conference and sent it to me for edits. I opened the abstract and I saw I was listed as second author. Except, the abstract is *100% my work from the last year*. To make matters even worse, he paraphrased half the abstract from one I had written earlier in the year--it is obvious if you read both. He had to ask me all sorts of details about it because he has no clue--he didn't even know how many samples had been used in the study.

I was also lucky enough to be invited this year to a meeting as part of an inter-governmental scientific policy group who work on something aligned with my topic. This year, they invited us to speak about our research as a sort of highlight. However, now my supervisor says I should ""focus on my work"" and he will go to the meeting alone since it's overseas. He doesn't want to burden me with having to travel. I now think this is just an excuse. And rather, he wants another opportunity to take credit for my work.

I think to add insult to injury, he is always giving me a hard time if I want to go to a conference. Just tonight, I asked if I could go to another in December and he basically said no--that it costs too much (my university *does not* have any funding issues and my project is massively funded). I was at one conference last week and he more or less forced me to come back early since ""staying for the whole thing is a waste of your time"". This particular conference is a smaller conference in exactly my subfield so it wasn't a waste of time.

But, up until now, I've never had the sense he is trying to actually take credit for my work. My question is this: what are my options here? I am listed as second author on the abstract for the conference and for the talk at the meeting I am sure he will put my name in tiny font on the title slide and that's about it. Am I within my rights to balk and refuse to provide figures or slides if I'm not there to even defend my work?

Basically I’m days away from giving my first public talk at a conference, on the first steps of my thesis work. Just for reference, my PhD is in radiology and my work involves NMR (i.e. MRI) for brain cancer. The problem is the whole time getting to this presentation has been stressful in ways I’ve never imagined. I just don’t “think” like an academic maybe, or maybe an academic biologist idk.

My background is in physics and engineering, and I *need* equations to understand things otherwise I neither get what’s going on, nor do I consider what was done to be rigorous. So I put equations on my slides to guide the process and I was told that those will put people to sleep. So I take them out and show my results only with some very superficial background  and then get told my slides don’t tell a story and are not scientific. I’m not arguing that the feedback is wrong but I just can’t conceptualize what tells a story without adding equations to the mix. I ask people but then they start asking about all my experimental parameters down to the nitty gritty and I say “I don’t remember” and then get a side lecture on how I need to know the data like the back of my hand. Or I’ll get asked “I’m assuming you also did such and such MRI scan to the animal?” And I’ll say “no” and then get scolded and that “i should know better” but the problem is I don’t know what’s good to do and what’s not because nobody ever tells me why we do anything, and I feel like when my lab mates forget to include certain scans they’re met with “oh ok”.  The literature also doesn’t explain the *why* for most things, and when I google theoretical explanations I find very qualitative answers.

The thing is I don’t think data/experiments are worth much if we don’t know the theory, but nobody else I work with seems to care about theory as much as they do results. During dry runs of my presentation I would get asked questions and not know the answer because I wouldn’t be able to formulate an answer based on theory, and would get met with disgruntled looks as the person who asked the question would say “You should know &lt;this random fact&gt;.” Meanwhile a colleague will present something that put me to sleep and get asked a question and then give a very hand-wavey answer and get told “Great job! Great answer!” So I don’t know what’s a good answer and what’s not, what’s a good presentation and what’s not, what’s acceptable to not know and what’s forbidden to not know. The things that I think are worth knowing are not generally considered worth knowing. What I think is rigorous is considered boring, and what I think is boring is considered rigorous. I answer questions with logic and get told that better answers use experimental results. I’m expected to warp my mindset to align with the masses but nobody is ever willing to challenge themselves and tackle things theoretically for my sake.

So anyway TLDR: my mind doesn’t work the same way as most other people out there and it has me frustrated b/c I have to cater to them while nobody caters to me.

However, some of my interactions with my professors have been very awkward due to my shyness and social anxiety around authority figures. Sometimes I have frozen up and not known what to say (I would forget my questions because I was so riddled with anxiety). Other times I have been so nervous that I forgot to even say hello when I walked into their offices (I beat myself up over that for a long time).

I'm trying to make a big effort to be friendlier just to avoid these awkward encounters and also to make my professors seem less intimidating to me. They probably wouldn't be as scary if I could just see them as regular human beings. I also feel like it would be beneficial for me to forge a strong professional and academic relationship with my professors, both in the short term and the long run.

What is the proper etiquette for being friendly with professors? I would never want to say anything that could be wrongfully seen as inappropriate or unprofessional. For example, if one of my professors had a picture of their family hanging on their wall, would it be inappropriate for me to compliment them on that? Is it strange to ask them what made them want to go into their chosen field of study? What would be some good conversation starters? 

I'm probably overthinking this way too much, but I really have zero social skills when it comes to authority figures. I live in fear of accidentally saying something wrong and offending them. Any advice would be appreciated.

I'm presently putting things in order for grad school, but I'm trying to come up with a long-term plan of what I'd like my future to look like. I very much want to do research, and the kind of thing I'd most like to work with is not particularly profitable or valued. (I'm studying plant/myco ecology, and the reason I'm thinking academia is one of my best options is because I would rather die than work in agriculture, management of lands/wildlife, etc. I do not want to forsake my very deep and special love for the natural world!) I also just thrive in academic environments, and have continually been told that it would be a great loss if I were to *not* become involved in research.

Thing is, I am hoping to get into a completely different line of work than research now. The job is a seasonal one (varies but generally mid April to mid August), but I'm pretty much dead-set on it because it fulfills me in other ways and will allow me a lifestyle that aligns with my fiance's. The seasonality of this job happens to be during the time most colleges, universities, etc have the summer break, but usually begins a bit early. I've looked at many academics calendars and the tail-end of spring sessions tend to overlap with the start of the summer seasonal job!

My questions..

\- Do academic institutions hire adjuncts / other teaching positions who can only work a single session annually? ie only fall sessions, as I am assuming spring sessions here would not be possible for me since the seasonal job starts up mid to late April..

\- If they DO, are people in these positions generally able to be involved in academic research? I don't necessarily care about directing my own independent research, just being able to participate in projects that feel personally meaningful.

\- If they DO NOT, are there any seasonal positions I could try for within academia that would allow me to participate in research, that aren't necessarily professorial in nature? Any outside of academia?

\- Lastly, how competitive are these kinds of positions relative to typical full-time faculty/professorial positions?

Just trying to figure things out here, and assess whether I should go for a PhD or not. I intend to acquire a Master's regardless. If it comes down to it, I will just settle for the seasonal job and try to fulfill my research interests/potential through other channels, like becoming very involved in a botanical/mycological society or something on the off-season, but if this dream of mine is actually attainable/possible then I want to keep dreaming!

I already have a full time job running my own independent business so this would be supplemental anyway. but because my life has largely been non-academic I’m wondering what makes the in-person interview different from other typical jobs.

I’m excited to have this opportunity, and I’m not using it as a means to launch fully into the university life. I am just hoping to prepare as much as I can. The interview itself is in four parts, with a portfolio review, teaching demonstration, and then two interviews, one with the existing faculty on a panel and another one-on-one with the department chair. Gonna be about three hours long, too. 

I’m pretty comfortable with everything except the interview portion. I’d appreciate any info on what to expect re: subject matter and any specific questions you think I may be asked. Any potential landlines to avoid would also be welcome!

I also am unsure how specific I should answer if they ask me things about my schedule and salary expectations. or, is that after they make me an offer and I don’t have to worry about that yet? i’m very very new to all this and i don’t want my naïveté to show.

Hi all,

I  accepted a funded PhD offer in a scientific field back in April. This summer, my mental health has been declining, in part because of anxiety about graduate school and because I no longer think the program is right for me. I am due to begin in mid-August. Is it ok for me to back out of  my offer? Does this count as dropping out, and what are the lasting  ramifications? Would I be able to re-use my undergraduate references when I reapply to schools in a year or two? I already signed a lease for an apartment, so this would  cost me a lot of money.

Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2018.  Grawe developed a metric he calls the ""higher education demand index"" (HEDI) and uses the book to call attention to the very predictable shift in demand for higher ed in the US in the 2020s. His chapter on four-year schools concludes that:

&gt;Between now and 2023, the number of students attending a four-year institution in the two years following high school graduation is expected to fall within 2 percent of enrollment levels today. Following this period of stability, **the HEDI shows a 7 percent rise through the year 2025 before the weight of the current birth dearth reduces enrollment more than 15 percent in the latter half of the 2020s**. In just four years, at the end of the forecast horizon, the four-year sector stands to lose almost 280,000 students.  
&gt;  
&gt;Accounting for both the brief increase and the subsequent decline, the model predicts approximately 150,000 (or 10 percent) fewer students in 2029 than today, a contraction only modestly smaller than that predicted for college-going in general.  \[Grawe, p.69; emphasis added\]

So while almost all US schools are hoping to see enrollment growth over the next decade, and basically everyone's financial models at least assume stable enrollment, we should expect a 10% *decline* in net enrollments by 2029. The bulk of that will come after a modest demographic bulge exits the system in the mid-2020s. These impacts will not be spread evenly among all colleges of course; the elites and well-endowed will do just fine. But some schools will be unable to weather such a storm-- if a school with 2,000 students realizes a net tuition revenue of $20,000 (on sticker price of $40K and a discount rate of 50%, let's say) that 10% decline would mean a $4M reduction in revenue with very limited corresponding savings due to high fixed costs (since they can't ""unbuild"" residence halls and the odds are the missing students will not come from any one department, so there may be no savings in faculty salaries either).

How many of our four-year colleges are preparing for this very predictable-- and likely permanent --decrease in demand? What if some version of ""free college"" actually makes it into policy, thus further eroding demand for private higher ed (and likely four-year public as well)?",17,26

&amp;#x200B;

I received an excellent offer to do a fully funded joint Economics-History PhD at a leading Russell Group university (think in the top 50 QS for the subject if we judge it like that and it is the same university I did my undergraduate at) and at the leading institution in Japan. Both are excellent places.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the supervisor would be the same person who supervised my undergraduate thesis. He knows me best and is as close to the ideal supervisor as you could think of—provided my references throughout the years, supported and mentored me, he was the one to offer the funding to me and the Japan opportunity even though other candidates were also in the running. He constantly inspires confidence and trust in my skills and seems that he is grooming me to maybe follow in his steps. Overall, a great guy. He is well known in his field, has a well developed network across US-Europe-Japan, is the editor in-chief at one of the leading journals in the field, is the Chair and Director of the department and was the Head of one of Europe's leading history society for a few years. The other supervisor, from Japan, is a rising Economics star (received his Professorship at an early age which I was told is very abnormal for Japan).

&amp;#x200B;

Even with all of this, I am thinking about whether it would be worth considering taking a year off and applying to Ivy Leagues and other top US universities. I talked about my research proposal widely with US academics and I have been actively encouraged to apply by professors at Princeton, Columbia, and Pennsylvania. I was always curious about the US system and attracted by its resources. I know the graduate admission statistics for these top US ones are insanely competitive and the risk of not getting a place is high. I would like to have a career in academia and would like to know if you think it would be worth the risk in applying for an Ivy League PhD or accept the offer I have been presented with?

Now the question: as I get ready for another year of advising grad students, what, if any, are the equivalent non-academic careers for PhDs? I don't necessarily mean high-paying jobs, but there have got to be employers out there who want people that write well, have good critical-thinking skills, and have the determination to see a long-range project through to completion.

I have conducted an extensive literature review and analysis, which included identification of key documents (and obviously their publishers as well). Based off of these findings I conducted interviews to gain insight on whether major stakeholders/ actors involved agreed with the findings, ie. the current summation of available literature, or not, and what their ideas for the future might be within this context. The interviews were conducted with a combination of those whose publications were analyzed in the previous stage as well as other key stakeholders whose publications were not selected for analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering, first, **what qualitative method I can use to justify my selection of stakeholders/ interviewees**, given that I have already conducted extensive data analysis, and do not have time to put together an in-depth stakeholder analysis - so far, however, I have completed the first 3 steps of a traditional stakeholder analysis, and held a meeting with a major stakeholder (who wants to remain anonymous) to confirm my selection of stakeholders interviewed. But step 4, or ""adaptation of tools"" seems to require another full-blown analysis. I can't just leave 4 of the 7 steps undone... but I already have what seems like a solid start here. Any ideas on a different qualitative tool that could be adapted to this?

&amp;#x200B;

Second, is the interview section. I am coming up short in terms of a **valid qualitative tool to analyze my responses** (also that doesn't require another in-depth analysis) **from my brief interviews** (including 5 interviewees, each in different positions, from different organizations). In the interviews I briefly summarized my findings and asked for elaboration on whether they agreed or not, had something else to add, saw certain trends or gaps, or recognized certain elements with potential as future solutions.  Again, are there any ideas on how to adapt a qualitative tool to analyze or summarize this?

I’ll be starting my masters this winter or next summer (and have plans for a PhD) and am wondering if anyone has experience with accommodations for not being able to give lectures/presentations?

I have narcolepsy with cataplexy that triggers panic attacks which makes it very difficult to stand up and give a talk. I struggle to stand under pressure because the stress causes my knees to buckle (cataplexy). And I lose feeling and some function in my hands (I shake like a leaf and struggle with things like clickers or drawing on a board). I also have to type out my entire presentation. I may not end up reading it verbatim but I need it to reference in case I go full narc and forget what I was speaking about mid sentence. 

The embarrassment of all this also just makes it very hard to speak and I end up a shaky mess on the verge of tears, barely able to remember my own name. I made sure to fast for at least 12 hours (so I can’t anxiety puke at the podium) and took shots of vodka in undergrad to get through some 5 minute speeches. I managed to get a pass on my senior thesis presentation because I was scheduled for an MRI at the same time. 

I am still shakey but okay if there’s only one or a few people in the room and I can sit down/am near an open door in case I need to bolt to the restroom, but I can’t even fathom having to present at a conference or having a public thesis defense.

* wanted to see what exactly I want to work in next. This was important, as it lead me to completely change the direction from neuroscience to longevity research (I have a MSc in molecular biology, so it's not super out of reach)
* during my PhD I was already in the process of starting a kinda-business\*, completely unrelated to academia or science in general (for the sake of it, let's say it was digital asset creation and management)
* I started getting panic attacks 8 months ago, which really slowed down my progress in reading and researching about the new field I want to switch to

So I have a ""gap"" of 20 months during which I was scientifically unproductive, but was productive in other areas. Do I just leave a blank space in my CV or do I state that I was in the process of building a kinda-business (which is still operating btw) unrelated to science? In how much detail should I go?

&amp;#x200B;

\*I'm describing it with the ""kinda"" prefix because it's not a registered entity or anything, it's just me and one of my buddies doing ""digital work"". I was able to survive these 20 months precisely because of that kinda-business, because, on average, it earns me around 2x of an average PhD salary (in Europe). It's passive income and keeps earning me money, but it needed to be built and maintained. Now when that's done, I'm ready for the next step, which is - research. I just don't want to shoot myself in the leg at the first step - sending the CV.",4,10

94,cho4at,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/cho4at/msw_vs_med/,MSW vs. M.Ed.,"Hi all,

 I am researching possible directions for grad school.  I had been seriously considering a Master of Social Work program until yesterday, when I ran across the Administration and Supervision, Higher Education Specialization program. I do a lot of volunteer work in the social justice realm, but I know social work doesn't often pay well nor have guaranteed job stability. I know there is a lot of work to be done in reforming the education system, but I also know the higher ed system can be a nightmare to work in (I have been support staff for a couple of years). I don't want to be a clinical social worker; policy and administration would be a better fit for me. Also, the MSW is a *very* rigorous program and I have concerns about my ability to complete it while working full time. 

I really enjoy working as a staff member, but I find that I’m lacking the skills and/or theoretical knowledge to foster success for students in my position. I have all of these ideas to improve the experiences of my student workers, but I don't have the theory and methodology to adequately implement programming with students or supervisors. My background is not in education and I don't think I see myself in a teaching position, but I like the idea of working in higher ed administration. 

* Having already earned a bachelors in a very niche department, I’m weary of jumping into a program that will pigeonhole me into one market. Is an M.Ed. at all marketable outside of the education system?  
* Is it frivolous to apply for the M.Ed. (which requires three letters of recommendation) if I'm not 100% sure it's the program I want to do? I'm concerned I'm being too impulsive here and I don't want to have to ask the same folks for letters of recommendation toward a different program next year. (The MSW only admits students in the Fall semester and I missed the deadline for this year).
* I work for the university at which I would be applying, so I get one free class per semester (4 per year). I've read that I shouldn't pay for an M.Ed., but an assistantship is likely not an option with my work schedule (I work M-F, 8-4:30). Should I pay for some classes, or just take a few years to get it for free? (There is a possibility that another department will pay for an additional class each semester).
* I have been using those free classes to work on a graduate certificate while I figure out the full program I want to do, so I haven't been completely out of the game as far as classes go. (It's a certificate in Women's and Gender Studies. It is free to me and has been helpful in acclimating myself to academia again.)

I’ve returned to academic study for the first time in 8 years, completing an online access course which awards a diploma as strong as three full a-levels (UK)

I’m currently doing my first assignment which is an English language assignment and have been asked to write an essay on gender stereotyping typing. I’ve now written my essay and am compiling the reference list, they have given me a left and right hand box, the left for the reference which needs to be in the Harvard style of course, and the right says I must ‘justify the source: fact or opinion?’ 

And I’m really bloody stuck.

For example, one article that they gave me to read and use as part of my research is by the United Nations human rights commissioner website and it’s an article which informs the reader about gender stereotypes, the definitions of the words, what they say about the meanings are factually correct; but how do I tangibly prove that what I’m reading is factual, just because I personally know it is? They don’t write ‘it is proven that ____’ they just say ‘a gender stereotype is the attribution of certain beliefs and principles which ought to belong to men or women based only on there social belonging to the gender of either man or woman’ this is correct; it wouldn’t be anything else.

But where’s the proof? 

In the article they also go on to say ‘gender stereotypes are harmful when ________’ surely this is opinion?

I just started doing research in the past 6 months, and I feel like I'm so far behind my peers its not even funny. I have a paper accepted for a small conference in the fall, but after talking to some folks at Phd programs at places like Stanford or MIT, I hear that students often come in with multiple first author publications. Is this true? I don't know how I can compete with that :/

I want to do research, I love it and have been working 80 hour weeks juggling two RAships and a research internship at a startup this summer, but I just feel like I won't be able to get into a solid background because of my non traditional background.

I'm finishing two Master's degrees, one in Biology and one in Computer science, from Harvard and Georgia Tech respectively. I previously did my undergraduate studies in Cognitive Science from UCSD. My GPA in my masters is a 4.0. I'll have theses written for each program as well.

My undergrad was non technical and weak (some family issues, I finished in 2.5 years without a strong focus on doing particularly well), and my research record is short, if a little intense. I've worked in Industry and have started a small, semi successful ML startup.
