I went to a school in Canada (McGill) but live in the US. There’s a store that you can order your academic regalia from for McGill but it’s in Canada (which is expected, duh) and they say you’ve got to pay customs fees if you order from the USA. Don’t know how much that could be, sent them an email to no avail. Called today but no response.  Just wondering if there are any places where I could get it from other than Canada and get the gown right ( slightly different than US PhD gowns).

14,bnc58f,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/bnc58f/feeling_a_bit_confused_on_receiving_a_poor_grade/,Feeling a bit confused on receiving a poor grade from a professor,"Just for reference here's how my professor allocates points:
-4 Exams 100 points each
-Homework is total 100 points and for each with less than 85% completion, -12 to overall homework.

Here's my exam grades(before curves):
-Exam One:49
-Exam Two:62
-Exam Three:40
-Exam Four:44
-Home work: missed 4 (-48)
(Didn't know where this fit so I just put it here)

So I was taking a class this semester with a professor that has a pretty well known history of being unbearable to take. As I'm usually a good student I figured everyone was being dramatic and he really could not be that bad right? Like the university has standards in place to protect the students, but I was quite wrong unfortunately. I'll admit he's very intelligent and knows his discipline very well but the class is not a great environment! You must make an 85% on home work or you get a zero for that assignment, I feel like it's worth noting pretty much every time I would try really hard to not use sites like Chegg but I genuinely didn't have the ability to complete the homework without it! It didn't really correlate with what was discussed in class other than some of the formulas we're derived, but that doesn't exactly aid me with indepth application. A couple of times I did attempt to go to his office hours and it was okay, but taking 19 credit hours and working 20-25 hours really doesn't leave me time to just live in this guy's office hours like I would've preferred.

Test average seems to be somewhere between 44-54 area but he is very vague with his feedback. I would either be right above the average for the class and for one I was just below(that test was average around 44 and I made a 40)

Now my university designates a specific date where you may drop the class and only receive a W, not great for the transcript but better than a failing grade. So I go to his office day of the W date, and his grades aren't put together to give me a good answer on my standing so he tells me to come back the next day, after the W date. I go back the next day, he says follow up at the end of the week. I go about a week later and he tells me I need a 50 on the final exam to receive a B, so I'm pretty ecstatic! Before I leave I made sure to ask that was everything and he confirms. 

So I begin prepping for my final, I end up making a 44, not the greatest but I'm only 6 points lower than what I needed, and after this semester with him I'll take anything that's passing so I was glad but I decided to email him just to verify I was still passing, so I email. He emails back and say I'm about 20 points (out of 500) into the D range. I'm completely surprised! I don't understand how I've gone from potentially making a B to failing this class...

I've tried talking to him but between me being not the most socially adept, or familiar with how to handle this, and him not being the most inviting personality I've gotten pretty much no where.

I suppose at this point I'm really not interested in getting a better grade(I genuinely don't feel like I have learned the course) but he really does a poor job at explaining what your grades are after tests. We use webassign and he only posts the raw grades, so at no point in the semester did I really understand what is going on. So I'm curious if I have any sort of standing to at least have his class changed! The environment is so bad, you always feel as if you are failing because grades are so bad and he gives very poor feedback. Is there anything I can do to have his class seriously looked into? It really doesn't seem like he respects the students and I always felt like my true grade was behind a door I was able to open. No one I've talked to has actually gotten a direct grade from him. He only will tell you, ""you need to make 'this' before the curve"", ""you need to make 'that' before the curve""

If you have any questions please let me know, I'm genuinely looking to try to make this class fair in the future, I'm almost willing to take the GPA hit even though it really does seem like a weird situation I'm an adult and willing to admit I shouldve kept up better with my homework. I just can't stand this attitude to grading is at my university and I really want to do something if I can.",12,0

What should I do about it?","I completed a hard science PhD with a bunch of fresh discoveries. During my *viva voce* my examiner was telling me he was kind of incredulous that I don't have my name on a single publication considering how much work I've done.

The really frustrating thing is that I agree with him that I should publish some stuff, but the postdoc supervising me and my actual project lead just weren't really that concerned about helping me get my first publication(s).

Repeatedly they would tell me ""It's not big enough"", but I've literally just found 3 papers from the last few months all containing practically the exact discoveries I made 3 years ago. Previously I didn't care but this has actually angered me.

I am the only person I know in my whole department who finished their studies without a single authorship (first or otherwise) and even some Masters students have more publications than I do. I'm also concerned that other people could publish my work after I'm gone and simply take credit for it, because there is favouritism in the department and I can see certain people moving on my work when they get the chance.

Is there anything I can do with my remaining material? Should I start trying to draft a paper (even though I've never done this before) or appeal to my supervisor(s) for help?

In all honesty I'm pretty jaded with academia at this point, it just feels depressing knowing that I did 5 years of work and essentially it's like it doesn't even exist to anyone except myself. Watching others get publications that I could have gone for with similar content is pretty soul destroying.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a very confused undergrad that has just finished her last exam ever in university. 

I'm hoping to ask for advice on how to choose my future path in academia. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did a degree in life sciences and a final year project in a molecular lab. For the most part of my undergrad life, I was quite unhappy doing ecology and took interest in a humanities subject. I managed to finish a minor on this subject and was so interested that I took extra credits and honours-level classes. Then I had a crazy idea to try and apply for the Master's programme. So I wrote a proposal, found a potential supervisor who kindly supported me and found out that I've been accepted into the programme with full coverage and a stipend for teaching undergrad classes. But during my final year project, I found that molecular research was quite interesting though I am not very good at it. Still, I find the humanities subject a lot more intriguing and I can see myself not getting as tired, stressed and upset.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really tight on finances right now so the low stipend from the humanities department is definitely a problem. If I were to go into sciences, my plan is to work a few years as a research assistant before applying for a PhD programme, so financially that is a better option. Also, I have a three-year bond to work in this country (I am a foreign student) because I had my tuition fees deducted as an undergrad, so the Master's programme in humanities would also mean that I am delaying paying this off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Academics of reddit, is pursuing something that I would love to do although it is filled with financial/administrative difficulty a wise choice? Did you find that a choice you made was worth it? I am really scared because going down either path feels like there is no way back.

I am applying to the Rhodes, Churchill, and Marshall this summer/fall. As a STEM student, I want to pursue a research Master's through any of these programs, but I am considering changing my research focus. I have conducted leukemia drug development research for 5 years and have been fortunate to have 6 publications (including a first author review). I have also been awarded the Goldwater Scholarship for it.

However, the past year, I have been losing interest in cancer inhibitors and instead gaining interest in neuroscience (especially systems/computational neuro). I kind of just stuck with the cancer research because I was a dumb college kid who was ""good"" at it. Nevertheless, if I will have a research masters, I want to really choose the field I am interested in personally. I have taken up upper-level neuroscience courses this past semester and I have also been self-studying some upper level math and programming to take more computational neuroscience courses next fall.

However, will this hurt my chances because ""I'm not a good fit"" due to my past experience. Have I relegated myself to a life of oncology research (no disrespect to those who are in this field)? I recently had a conversation with the Churchill Scholarship committee chair and he claimed that if the neuro lab I contact in the UK agrees to take me, then the committee will be completely fine with the change?

In January of this year, this collaborator had requested my help with an abstract she was planning to submit to a conference taking place in the spring.  She is NOT my boss; working with her is not an essential part of my duties for my job, and I am not funded by any of her grants.  Therefore, I had the freedom to turn down this collaboration if I had wanted; I agreed to help as a favor for a colleague who was too busy to help this collaborator and for purposes of relationship-building, good karma, and adding more to my publication count.  I had worked with this collaborator in the past, and had problems with her before, including rude, passive-aggressive comments about how I didn't respond to her e-mails quickly enough, and an incident in November, when she sent me a request for help with an analysis for another project and gave me less than six days to do it (I had not known about this project at all before her request, and the deadline was a hard deadline because it was for an abstract submission).

But nonetheless, I agreed to help her.  Initially, I didn't really think there was anything out of the ordinary going on.  Here was the rough sequence of events leading up to a very unpleasant exchange on Friday:

* Early February: I give her all the material she needed from me to complete the abstract.  She submits the abstract and I assume that I could take a break from this and devote more attention to my other projects.
* Mid-February: she keeps asking me for more analyses.  This happens several times; I didn't think they were time-sensitive given that we had already submitted the abstract.  But I try to be a good collaborator and give her the analyses she wanted.
* Late February: I hit a particularly busy time with my other work and I don't respond to her request for an analysis quickly enough.  She sends me an e-mail telling me that I need to respond to her within a reasonable time frame and sends me a list of more tasks to complete.  I send an e-mail back saying that I wasn't aware that any of this was time-sensitive given that we had already submitted the abstract, that other work was keeping me occupied, and that her project was not the only thing I had to do.  She then tells me that this was for a manuscript she was planning to submit in a few months.  This is the first I have heard of this manuscript, and I ask to see a draft of what she has so far; she responds that this was a plan (no draft or outline yet) and that I was to get everything she asked of me first, and then she would send a draft for my review.
* Early March: I do some of the tasks she asks of me, but I'm lost, because I'm not sure of what she wants in this manuscript.  I send her some updates and ask her what the research question underlying this manuscript is to be, and tell her I would really like to see an outline or something.  She ignores my question and reiterates her request for the remaining material from me.  I tell her that I will not do any more analyses until I see an outline or an initial draft and a research question; I emphasize that I'm only asking this because I want to get as much right as possible the first time around.
* One week later: a tense standoff between us ensues that ends with her sending me a very rough draft, which helps somewhat.  I look at the author list and notice it's three authors; I'm second author, and this is the same as the author list for the abstract she submitted in February.  Over the next few months, and after a few calls back and forth, I complete the remaining tasks she requests of me.

Yesterday, she e-mailed me with picky details about the plots and tables I gave her.  I asked her why what I had included was not sufficient, and asked for clarification on what she wanted.  She gave a response, and said in her e-mail that ""she thought she had already explained it to me.""  She also said that some ""labels"" in the plots were wrong, and that I was to let her and some other colleagues handle it.  I wasn't sure what the ""labels"" referred to.  Included in her e-mail was a request to ""please provide the analyses that they wanted, and that I needed to the analyses just like my predecessor did.""

I sent an e-mail asking who ""they"" was and what parts of the ""labels"" were wrong.  She responded with a very brief sentence that ""they"" were the investigators that initiated the study; I have reason to believe that ""they"" does not include the first author of this manuscript, and this is also the first time I was aware of the involvement of these investigators.  Meanwhile, she ignored my question about the ""labels"" and asked me again to make the changes to the tables that she requested.  I sent her another e-mail asking for the names of these investigators so I knew who I was working with, and telling her that it would probably be much easier for everyone if she told me exactly how she wanted me to do the plots and what she wanted to say in them so I could make the changes myself.  Her response was, word-for-word:

""BulletproofHeart2003,

You are really not easy to work with.""

So anyway, something about this entire situation really does not sit well with me.  It's more than just my frustration, her having little respect for my time, and her ingratitude; the fact that she not only get defensive when I asked her questions about who was involved in this and how I could help with these plots, but got rude makes me suspicious about what really is going on.  For example, why was the identity of these investigators such a big secret?  Also what was really strange was that they were left off the author list for the initial abstract and were not included in the author list for this manuscript; if they had initiated the study, shouldn't they have been listed as co-authors also?

What are everyone's thoughts?  Feel free to be as blunt as you want.  I'm planning to go to my boss and explain the entire situation, and ask that further requests for collaboration from this person not be directed toward me.  I am seriously considering just walking away right here and now from this collaboration; what would be the ramifications?  I should also point out that this woman was recently caught submitting an abstract using her collaborators' data that had not yet been published, without their permission; given her previous unethical behavior, I feel I have another reason I have to be concerned.  I just feel that not only am I being jerked around, but given all the lack of communication and information asymmetry, I honestly do not trust this collaborator.",9,12

55,bka68t,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/bka68t/im_an_undergraduate_teaching_assistant_but_i/,"I'm an undergraduate teaching assistant, but I essentially do everything a professor does. How legal is this?","As the title states, my professor, who happens to be the Dean of a college at my university, hired me to be his TA in my senior year of undergrad. I accepted, thinking I'd be taking attendance and helping facilitate class discussions. 

As a disclaimer, this is an upper level English literature course, and the maximum number of students we can have is 25, so this is not one of those big lecture classes. It's very intimate and we spend most of our time engaging in round table discussions and I know all of the students personally. 

The professor teaches 2 different literature courses--one in the fall and one in the spring, both of which I had taken and passed with flying colors prior to being the TA. 

For the past two years (senior year and 'super senior' year) I have been the TA for both the fall and spring courses. My goal is to be a professor eventually, so at first it was like a dream come true. I weighed in a lot in making the syllabus and choosing the readings every semester, I take attendance and facilitate discussions daily, and I'm always active and present in the class. 

However....

I also assign and grade all of the papers (of which there are 6 per semester), I help make the final and midterm and grade them on my own, I make pop quizzes, I answer all of the student questions/emails because the prof is unresponsive, and I often have to ""cover"" for my professor because he's not prepared, hasn't read the text, isn't interested in the class because he's the Dean and has tenure. I have access to all of the students' grades, since I am the one who keeps track of them, and my professor opens my gradebook at the end of the semester to manually input the grades into the school system, which I obviously do not have access to. While I don't mind essentially being the professor for the class (I do 95% of the work), I am not getting credit for it. All 100 of my students in the past 2 years have told me that I have essentially been the instructor of the course, with our prof popping in and out for inspirational anecdotes that have very little to do with the class. While I am glad my students have had a positive experience taking ""our"" class, it feels really unfair that I do practically everything, and get paid ""okay"" for it. Additionally, I have been told by other department heads and people in academia who work in other universities that it is highly abnormal for an English professor with such a small class to hire an undergraduate teaching assistant for an undergraduate course, and I'm beginning to wonder if, when I pursue a PhD in the future, this will hurt to have on my resume. 

The only undergraduate TAs I know are in the engineering department, and there are about 3-4 for classes of 100+ and they just help with assignments, take attendance, and hand back graded pop quizzes. I have never met or heard of another undergraduate TA who's as involved as I have to be. Again, I don't mind this work, as it's a wonderful opportunity for someone who's 21-22, but I'm beginning to question the legal aspect of it and wondering if it's going to hurt me in the future, rather than be a huge stepping stone for graduate school. 

Right now I'm looking for insight and advice. 

To clarify, the professor/dean is in his 50's-60's and I was his student when I was 20, became his TA at 21, and am currently 22 and most likely not going back to being his TA after the spring semester is over.",32,10

I'm working in a large research group that has lots of PhD students.

First off, why do I feel I lag behind my fellow students? Because all other current PhD students in this group, from 1st-year to final-year, have won a poster prize or a talk prize at a conference or have published at least one paper. I've done none of those things. And they all have given a seminar on their PhD project during our group meetings. Again, I've never done that. 

So why haven't I done any of those things? Because I haven't made substantial progress in my project. So what's in the way? My supervisor and I are exploring a research area he's unfamiliar with, so the progress is really slow. When he decided to take me on as a PhD student, he told me about the project I'm gonna do, which is within a subfield he had been doing for decades. But after I got here, he changed his mind and became interested in a subfield he doesn't know much about, so he told me to do a project in this subfield. And it turns out we've been doing it slowly. Actually in our department there is a PI who's familiar with this, but my supervisor never talks with him, and I don't know why. I happened to talk to one of that PI's students, and I found that what I'd been doing was significantly flawed. That means I wasted almost a year. I feel quite annoyed - why isn't my supervisor collaborating with that group? He himself knows little about this area, and he's been wasting my time! Now it's almost the end of my second year, but I feel I've learned nothing from my supervisor and made no contribution to human knowledge. By comparison, the other students in our group are all doing things familiar to the supervisor and have made lots of progress. 

Although I've been feeling bad, whenever I felt like asking my supervisor to change my project, I failed to do so. One reason is that I find my supervisor's really passionate about this miserable project; the other reason is that, if I manage to get a new project, I'll probably have to start over and spend three more years to finish my PhD - that's too costly! What should I do now? I'm really worried about myself. I planned to stay in academia after I graduate, but now I've got nothing to put in my CV and I start to think I can't even find a decent job outside of the academia. I need your advice badly.",16,3

I’m just here venting a little because I don’t have it in me to tell anyone I know. 
I’ve struggled with imposter syndrome since early high school, usually I can talk myself out of it. 
The further I get into academia the harder it gets to get over feeling like a fake. 
The last few days I have been full of anxiety. At least that’s what I think it is. I’ve never felt this way before. 

Mostly this post is me whining a little and hoping someone posts their own story in the comments so I can maybe feel better about myself.

96,btyonb,/r/academia/comments/btyonb/update_on_my_shady_collaborator/,Update on my Shady Collaborator,"Thank you to those who commented on my previous post about this research collaboration gone sour. For those of you who have not read it, the link to the original post is here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/bnql1m/something\_about\_this\_collaboration\_feels\_very/](https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/bnql1m/something_about_this_collaboration_feels_very/)

It seemed that almost everyone was in agreement that this collaborator’s behavior was seriously problematic, that I should have never got involved with her in the first place, and that I should terminate this working relationship as soon as I could.

Even before I had written that post, I was strongly considering immediately stopping all work on this project, letting my direct supervisors know that I never wanted to work with this person again, and telling this collaborator that I was done. Your responses solidified that decision for me. Looking back, I really should have paid attention to the warning signs like some have said; my mistakes were really giving her one too many chances and trying to make everyone happy (two things that I have been very prone to defaulting to, many times even at my own expense, but that’s another story for another day). I now realize fully that this was a very unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship; these were not typical disagreements or quibbles. Considering that I could see no way to salvage this working relationship and that the reward for me for sticking with it, an uninteresting second-author publication, would not really help me all that much, there really was no reason for me to continue.

I wanted to wait until the dust settled before providing an update. And I felt the update is substantial enough to warrant more than a simple “Update: I spoke to my boss and bailed on this project; thanks for everyone’s input” at the top of my original post. This collaborator turned out to be much shadier than I ever expected; I knew she had committed at least one research ethics violation in the past (which I had found out about after I started working with her), but I found out there was much more.

The next day back at the office, the first thing I did was forward the chain of e-mails between her and myself (which included the disturbing secretive behavior and the rude comments) to my bosses and the colleague that referred her to me, gave my side of the story, and requested that I never work with this collaborator again. Not five minutes had passed before one of my bosses came to me and told me that nobody should ever work with this collaborator under any circumstances. It turned out that my boss also had worked with her in the past and witnessed her unprofessional behavior and questionable research practices first-hand. In fact, it had gotten so bad that my boss had walked away from a collaboration with her and refused to work with her again. If my boss had known that I was working with this person (aside from some uncommon cases which did not include this, I do not need my boss’ permission for research collaborations), she would have strongly discouraged me from getting involved.

From working with this collaborator in the past, my boss also knew that this collaborator was explicitly told by her direct supervisor not to work on certain types of projects. The project I was helping her with fell in that category (I did not know this before and this explained a lot of her information hoarding). This was also not the first time she went behind her boss’ back and worked on projects she was not allowed to work on; it turned out that a previous project I had helped her on (and one that I unknowingly took over for my boss) also fell in this “forbidden” category, and I was not aware of this either. My boss and I both agreed that I should just stop all work on this project immediately, especially considering this collaborator’s direct supervisor was the head of my division. This bothered my boss so much that she even insisted that everything be forwarded to the head of our division.

The first chance I got, I myself sent an e-mail to this collaborator saying that given her rudeness to me in her last e-mail and my concern over her information hoarding, I forwarded the e-mail chain between us to my bosses and that I was going to immediately halt any work on this project. I also requested that my name be removed from the manuscript in preparation and that she never contact me again for future research collaborations. She responded one day later with a curt “I will remove you from the manuscript.” And that was that; no explosions or fireworks, although I was prepared for that to happen. Just the embers of a flame flickering out.

Hopefully this is the end of this drama and I hope I never have to see or speak to her again. I’m seriously pissed off that she would withhold information like that to get somebody else involved in something she knew was not allowed. The possibility that a collaborator could do this never crossed my mind; I put a certain amount of trust in people I work with, and she seriously betrayed that. I could have also gotten in quite a bit of trouble myself as her unwitting accomplice. I’m also pissed at her rudeness toward me and her sense of entitlement toward my help and my time when I was working with her on something she was not allowed to do. Given her squirrelly behavior, I do also seriously question the integrity of the data I was working with and the project.

Fortunately, I will not suffer any consequences; my bosses both clearly said they were fully on my side, and disciplinary actions against me were not even considered. The same cannot be said for her; apparently, this was the breaking point after repeated problematic behavior, and now, she is in some serious shit. Whatever happens to her, she brought it upon herself and I have no sympathy for her whatsoever.",5,39

A few days later I take an international flight and when we land realize the professor had sent an email while I was on the flight requesting my assignment to be submitted electronically. I then realize the professor never actually went to the folder to check for my submission but just assumed I never completed the assignment.  That said, I immediately submit the assignment electronically and send an email explaining my international flight    situation but never get a response and receive a 0 for the assignment. I have been trying to meet the professor in office hours but to no avail as they are never in their office. For context, during the course the professor and I had become good friends and I was the only one with perfect attendance and had received the highest grades on all other assignments.

104,bmj3fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/bmj3fw/acceptable_peerreview_timetable/,Acceptable Peer-Review Timetable?,"Hi.

I'm in the humanities, and submitted a MS to a journal over four months ago.  Since then, I haven't heard anything, positive or negative.  I've been through the peer-review process many times before, but I've never had a wait this long - and since the article's focus is something quite timely, I'm concerned about 'shelf life' of the article - taking into account that, if the response from this journal is negative, I will need another few months for the next submission/review process.  (For context, I'm in the humanities.)

Question:  is it, at this point, acceptable to contact the editors and ask for an update?  I'll note that the MS was submitted through one of the 'third-party' submissions services, so I haven't had any previous contact with the editorial board to this point.  I did send a message to the submission service via their online form - but this was over a week ago, and I've received no response from them.

Any input welcome - and thanks.",23,7

She's working on her PhD thesis. In her department-wide email, she claims that the research project is well-funded and project collaborators will be paid.

Anyway, since I'm an int'l student (limited to on-campus work), she said that monetary payments will send off red flags (immigration law). However, it is clear that immigration law permits on-campus work.

Therefore, she intends to buy some items for me as compensation. Wouldn't you say that this is an inappropriate practice?

P.S.

Also worth noting that she set up an appointment, was late for 15 minutes, set up another one, and then missed that one before all of this happened. That's what makes it really fishy as well.

I've decided not to proceed with the work.

Our family is grown up now, and I'm in my early thirties - have I been out for too long? Do you think a masters would be a good route back in to science?

I live with an hour of two good universities, so it could be an option - they other option would be trying to find a scientific job, perhaps research assistant somewhere, but do you think my time out would significantly count against me? I'd be going up against recents grads I suppose?
