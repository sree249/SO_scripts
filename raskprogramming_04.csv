My team is integrating with a payment gateway called OpenEdge (this is *not* the programming language from Progress).  The problem we're having right now is that we cannot securely tokenize a CCN from the client side, so we'd have to send the CCN plaintext to our server to tokenize, and this increases our PCI scope.  (Another payment gateway we're using allows us to tokenize using JS securely.)

I've searched the internet for a third-party tokenizer, and I did manage to find TokenEx which seems to be the right idea, but it's not integrated with OpenEdge.  I dug through a *lot* of stuff, but didn't find anything.

Would anybody happen to know of a third-party tokenizer that's compatible with OpenEdge?

Thanks.

Update: If I could change the name of the post, I'd change it to ""Third-party tokenizer for payment gateway"", because I forgot that tokenization is not limited to payment gateways.  :\",0,2,2019-04-20 20:03:18

In it's own class I'd say but I'm  not really sure. Same with the code to interact with the database: adding and removing rows should be part of the `Customer` class file?

There will be a relational database (Postgres) to handle the web app portion of the app-

* Parse the raw data out of the PDF
* Clean the data
* Classify it
* Extract key data values

Every time I process a PDF, I want to save the results at each step to ensure my algorithms are improving.

Should I store the results at each step in the same Postgres db or in some other datastore?

            item.co2 = co2
            item.is_public = is_public
            item.save()

have a lot of products and it would be much easier to add the subcategories to the csv as well. Simple example: product\_class: electronics. categories: mobile phones (1) &gt; android phones (2) &gt; samsung phones (3).

No money changes hands. It's all about bragging rights. Each of us picks four golfers, and the sum of the scores of all four is your score. Lowest score at the end wins. 

During the four days of the tournament, we check who is ahead or behind often. It's time consuming to look up 16 scores and total up our relative positions, so a few years ago I whipped up a quick and dirty Google Site that did the work for us. The Google Site would scrape the Leaderboard, which I could always find somewhere online as an HTML table, then write to a page showing our relative positions at any point during the tournament. 

I can no longer find the Leaderboard published as an HTML table. All the Leaderboard sources now seem to be rendered in JavaScript. This breaks my Google Site. 

I'd like to build a quick and dirty site that can scrape a JavaScript Leaderboard and display the totals for each of our four golfers. 

Here are my design constraints: 

1. I'd like to build this site somewhere where I could host it for free. It will get tiny traffic only four days of the year. It will require a tiny amount of storage.
2. I think I can teach myself what I need to know to scrape the JavaScript, but I'd like to make that process as efficient as possible. Decades ago I was a strong programmer, but that was pre-Internet and pre-C++. Stone Age. Twenty years ago I did teach myself enough Python to write network admin scripts. A few years ago I did teach myself some C++ (my son and I both took an online MIT Intro course). Naturally, though, the less I have to put into this to get it done, the better. When I Google this issue, it looks like there are lots of Python libraries that will make it work, but is Python the best bet? I can find services that will let me host a small Python site for free, but if I make a different choice, would I have better hosting options? 
3. Wherever I do it and whatever I do it in, I'd like for the environment to be stable and last for as long as possible. Ideally, I maintain this site for one hour per year and then it just works. 

To sum it up, what's the simplest way to build this site, and where is the easiest place to host it?

Since I'm relatively inexperienced when it comes to front-end development I wrote the front-end using basic html, css and javascript (for handling Ajax operations and element behaviors), to keep things simple. As the number and complexity of components started to increase, I started using a template-engine [Pug](https://pugjs.org), which seems to be fairly popular. At this point, when I need to add things like modals as well as aesthetic elements, I've started to include dependencies like [material-design-lite](https://getmdl.io) and [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). The current interface is basically a login page which leads to a dashboard that has a bunch of data as well as controls for functionality. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I'm facing is that writing the front-end code for something as straightforward as a form for a new transaction is very time consuming, and the development time for the UI is blowing up to the order of what it took me to write the back-end API. Is this expected? Are there any specific tools that I can use to cut down on this time; anything would be helpful but I had something along the lines of the UI-editor in Android Studio, in mind.",4,11,2019-04-29 07:03:44

I have been working part-time job for 6 months now as a embedded software engineer. I got the job by completing the course that the company organised. 

The thing is I feel like I do not learn enough. For the past 6 months I had various success with the tasks I'm given. I have spent months on tasks that I feel like should have taken a few weeks. Now I am pretty fluent with the language (C) and toolkit that company uses, but the internal architecture of software I'm am working on is really challenging for me. I roughly understand how everything works, but some of the concepts are hard to understand for me.

I feel like my efficiency is at the bottom. Right now I'm sitting for third week on remaking one function. It is hard one, recursive one that calls few other ones. It took me around a week to understand what it fully does. Then I tinkered with it for pretty much a week. The are not much of docs to work with, but I am utilizing everthing I have. I asked my mentors about it, but one of them is really busy recently and he does not help much when it comes to details, and my second one is on holidays.

To give you background, I am 3rd year student (out of 5) and I still have to do a lot for it, it's pretty busy sometimes. I also learn a lot from work, but I feel like I am really slow. I work with my groupmate, and by the looks of it I can't say that he feels the same way I feel. He does more than I do, from what I can see.

So my question is dedicated mostly to seniors or middles, who work in the field. Is it ok for a junior to be slow just like I am? If you are junior, do you feel or felt the same at some point of you career?

Or maybe I'm overthinking. I do not get any pressure neither from my mentors nor from big bosses nor anyone. Noone ever told me that I am too slow. Maybe because I am not, or maybe because of work ethics. I want to understand that I am working with my speed. I am really trying to do things faster, I am trying to spend as less time on doing nothing at work, and this is just my speed of doing work. 

What is your opinion on that? I really need external input.",5,2,2019-04-29 14:17:31

I'm writing a program in C++ that involves the calculation:

x = 2^(N-1) mod N.

I need to run this calculation as N increases, but I'm running into a bottleneck due to the max integer size allowed in C++ (or the IDE I'm using, not sure which one is limiting me).

The calculation works until N is greater than 32.  It seems to me that integers are stored in 32 bits (with the first bit signaling pos/neg), and thus when N is larger than 32, 2^(N-1) becomes too large.

Normally, I would use logarithms to make this calculation more manageable for large N.  However, I'm having issues with trying this because the calculation also includes modular division.  I've been playing around with the math, and I'm having a hard time working out how a logarithm might run through modular division (or if it's even possible).

Has anyone encountered a problem like this, or have any tips so that I can make the calculation work for larger N?

&amp;#x200B;

On the project that I am working on at the moment, we are looking to allow users to create custom functionality using specific functions that we define. On top of this, we also would like users to be able to use usual programming constructs like loops, variables etc.. The project is written in Java so we will need a way to run the language directly as if by ""evaling"" code. 

&amp;#x200B;

One way I have thought about doing this is by using an already created language and just ""evaling"" that. For the admin part of the project, we use Java's ScriptEngine combined with groovy to allow us to execute functions as we need but we cannot do this for the users in the same way due to the massive security implications. If there was a good way to lock down the eval, that could work quite nicely and could be a potential way to go forward with this.

&amp;#x200B;

The other way I have been looking into is creating some sort of custom language or DSL in order to provide all the functionality we need but having fine-grained control over what users can and cannot do. This adds quite a bit of complication because with implementing a new language you are not only creating a new part of the project to be intensively designed and tested but also a potential security issue if everything is not done 100% correct. 

&amp;#x200B;

For this reason, I would much rather use a language that already exists and to be able to lock it down but I'm open to all different ways to do this. All of this is very theoretical so feel free to throw a complete spanner in the works and suggest something completely radical!

This is for an art piece which will be shown as part of an installation. The conversation outputs of person A will be shown on one iPad and person B's side of the conversation will be shown on another iPad.

So essentially person A says something and then person B will say something... etc. I apparently need to host this on a website online so that we can access it on the iPads.

Since I know the consensus is that C is low level and only really used for low level things, I figured I'd try learning a higher level language that has certain advantages over C, specifically in being able to write and test out a function very quickly, so I can see that more complicated ideas actually work pretty well before dedicating the time to really write them out optimally. I think it'd be cool to be able to change the variable values of a program and evaluate them as the program is actually running as it'd make debugging and testing pretty fast and easy, but that's completely optional.

My friend does the business side whilst I'm ostensibly supposed to do the technical side. However I feel a bit out  of depth as I know very little about  QR codes and app development in general (I'm a desktop developer).

My initial idea is to  use the QR code to display each item's  production information and intended destination by embedding  this data into the code itself. Then publish an app to read the QR  code, however other regular QR code readers should not be able to read anything.

I'm somewhat confused as to what a QR  code actually is, because from my understanding a QR is simply a link for the device to connect to, but other research suggests that the QR can also embed  data and possibly execute code.

My questions are:

1) Is it possible for QR to execute code, or be more  than just a web link? Is there an API I can read?

2) How would I print the QR code?

3) Is it possible to lock QR code data behind certain user profiles on the app? e.g. a client who logs into the app as a 'consumer' will see some data on the QR code but will be obfuscated from what a, say, 'customer' profile sees.

4) How complicated will the QR   look?

5) Is  there a way to track the amount of times a QR code has been scanned and where it is scanned from?

Alternatively, if you are interested in knowing more about  the project, I am looking for a UI/UX  designer and an app developer to  help  me out. We're based in the UK and it will  be about a 6 month project. PM me if you want more details!",18,1,2019-04-15 07:30:21

I will upload the data file on request for anyone who wants to poke at that too.

In this assignment, you will analyze weather data. You can find the data by clicking here. You Need to write a program in Python that will apply the following tasks:

Filter the attached/linked file and keep the following columns only: STATION, NAME/LOCATION, DATE, AWND, SNOW. Then save the filtered file and name it filteredData.csv. For each NAME/LOCATION, calculate the average snow amount per month. Save the results in two separate .csv files (one for 2016 and the other for 2017) name the files average2016.csv and average2017.csv For each NAME/LOCATION, calculate the total/ sum snow amount per month. Save the results in two separate .csv files (one for 2016 and the other for 2017) name the files total2016.csv and total2017.csv Sort the data in the files average2016.csv and average2017.csv. Store only the top 3 locations from each file. The top 3 locations data will be stored in one file, name it top3.csv. Each column in the top3.csv file will store the results of each year. Thus, the top3.csv file will have the columns 2016 and 2017. From the 2 year data, find the top 10 readings/rows of AWND. Store the result in a file .csv file and name it top10AWND.csv. The new file will have all columns from filteredData.csv, but only the top 10 AWND.",5,0,2019-04-15 10:33:05

I have been learning web development over the past few years and have progressed significantly. Right now I am learning React. However, in my studies I run across a recurring problem: I see something in some code, and it is unexplained. The problem I'm running into right now is very specific, but can be generalized pretty easily. For example, this syntax from the styled components documentation:

    const Button = styled.button`
      /* Adapt the colors based on primary prop */
      background: ${props =&gt; props.primary ? ""palevioletred"" : ""white""};
      color: ${props =&gt; props.primary ? ""white"" : ""palevioletred""};

      font-size: 1em;
      margin: 1em;
      padding: 0.25em 1em;
      border: 2px solid palevioletred;
      border-radius: 3px;
    `;

My Javascript is not great, I am learning it but it will be a while before I know it all. Here I don't understand what the ` is doing. Presumably that's some kind of base Javascript functionality, but I don't understand what it does?

Is there somewhere where I can input code and have it highlight what the syntax is? For example, in Python if I input something that contained ""Foo.attribute"" it would link me to using the attributes of an object.

It seems like it would be pretty straight forward to build seeing as how interpreters already know what all the syntax means.

I have an RAII object of type `manipulate`, whose destructor undoes the mutation it causes when it falls out of scope, much like `std::lock_guard`. The problem is that the user has to type `auto _=` or the destructor will get called before `model.get_info();` I don't like that the user has to type `auto _=`. Why would a user think to create an object that is never used?

&amp;#x200B;

My first idea was to make the constructor `[[nodiscard]];` but constructors have no return values. Is there a way to tell the compiler that `manipulate` rvalues should have lvalue lifetimes?

From reading the docs and checking some examples, this should set the application title in my KDE environment. But it doesn't, the application name is the name of the executable.

Is this a bug in KDE or am I doing something wrong?

This function is unmodifiable, and there are no options being passed in the third parameter, so I would expect this listener to be removed. It does not. This is the only time I'm referencing the function *listener*, I created it specifically to isolate the problem.

What I would really appreciate is some insight on why this could be happening, when I look online at why eventListeners can't be removed, it's always because the function passed is anonymous or was not the same, this is a named const, only referenced once, so it should be the exact same on removeEventListener.

You control the white circle with arrow keys. Your goal is to get the yellow circle (score). The game count how many scores you collected. The gray circle is some kind of an enemy. If you touch it it set your streak to ""0"" and teleports you and itself away in random location. The blue rectangle is a teleport. If anything touches it it teleports the object somewhere randomly. You also have a highscore which contains the highest streak you ever had. I added a reset button if you want to reset the whole game.

My first thought was that I'd need licensing, otherwise it's unlikely that I'll sell more than 1 copy ;). I have no experience with this at all so I'd like some input. So far this is what I've got:

* 2FA-style in-house licensing. Customer calls me when he's ready to activate, he gets a code on his screen generated from the current time and I give him the code that unlocks the program. The problem with this is that it requires me to be available and have access to my computer when they call.
* Using a free licensing service such as [License Spring](https://licensespring.com/). I'd rather go that route because it's more of a set it and forget it approach. I give the customer a license key when he buys it and License Spring makes sure it's only activated on 1 PC at a time. Too good to be true?

There are two routers named **S1** and **S2**. The bandwidth of the link connecting the two routers is **100Mbps**. The bandwidth of the links that connect users to the routers is **10Mbps**. The users connected to the S1 router are always sending data to the users connected to the S2 router. All S1 users generate **1Mbps** traffic on average. From time to time, the traffic generated by S1 users reach up to **10Mbps** instantaneously. If **circuit switching** is implemented, what is the average rate of data transfer on the network?

My ideal tool would allow me to create a new directory that thinks it is root.  It is not able to see any of the packages I've installed through my package manager, it can't see any files outside itself besides whatever OS files it needs, etc.  From the perspective of this new directory, it is the root folder of a freshly installed Linux (or whatever else) machine.  It has all of the default environment variables, default installed software, etc etc etc.  I want to be able to install whatever I want using a package manager and be able to have all of it gone when I delete the directory.  I want the environment variables that I change to only effect that directory, not all the directories around it.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, here are the reasons why none of the 4 options I listed fit what I need:

Docker does a lot more than what I need.  It's proprietary, it has a high learning curve, etc.  It's just too much.

Python virtual environments are really close to what I want, but I need something language agnostic.

AutoEnv and DirEnv I honestly haven't put too much thought into.  Autoenv hasn't been updated in a year, and DirEnv, although it looks to be actively updated,  still has a very small community.

Does the tool I'm looking for actually exist, or am I the only one who gets massive headaches trying to manage their various environments?",3,3,2019-04-16 22:35:46

Am I wrong here?","At my company we are currently discussing a new database design for our applications. We are a small B2B consulting company, our applications rarely see more than 100 concurrent users as they are typically only accessed by a client admin or analyst. We use MS SQL Server 2017 for our RDBMS.

The new design that our sr. devs have come up with involves splitting up data into separate databases, with common client information in one database, and then separate databases for each product in our suite (we have 3 distinct products). I have several issues with this design, one of them being that splitting up information this way takes away the ability to set foreign keys, and that it will be harder to maintain integrity in the long run. We process mainly transactional data, our largest product involves financial information.

The sr. devs have been pretty hand-wavy toward my concerns, saying that they will just enforce integrity in the application. They also say that FKs will impact performance too much and that they aren't necessary. I understand that FKs do come with a slight performance impact, but I'm unsure how the application is supposed to handle integrity without having an impact on that side. The other thing is that our applications are serving a very low number of concurrent users, and is not real-time. Given the type of information we are dealing with, my opinion is that maintaining rock-sold integrity outweighs the slight performance impact of FKs in our case.

Am I being crazy or unreasonable in this case? Is it common to use this type of database design in other enterprise applications?

My current specialties are Selenium UI tests and JMeter load tests so I kinda want to make something of my own in my spare time (2-3 hours in the evening) to sharp up my programming skills even further.

So far I've made a desktop WPF app that allows you to run JMeter tests in non-GUI mode but without the hassle of entering a butt load of command lines into the console.

The app is more or less done so I'm wondering which simple project could I start that would occupy me for a while when I'm bored at home?

Hello, 

In the company I work for, we want to have a database where we store information about every device we produce. We make different hardware devices (about 10k per year maybe). Each device is tested after production. The test checks voltage Levels etc. and checks some other data. Every device has a unique ID that is also collected. Right now, a worker just checks that everything is okay, and marks that device as checked. Now we want to keep the Information from every test, so we need a database or logging system that saves all this collected data. I imagine that like a mongoDB or similar, saving a JSON for every device checked. 

The logs might be appended later, if a device comes back for repair or similar, and also binary files should be stored. Ideally the data can be send to this system via REST-Commands. Also, later workers need a visual tool to get information about one or more devices (Note that these works usually can not formulate a SQL-like queries, so they need some input masks with option menus to find what they need), and to append logs after repair etc. 

Now, I could build that probably with a mongoDB, some Webserver with a REST interface plus some custom build Web-UI, but I think that this is kind of a typical application, so I would guess there are already some ready-to-use systems on the market. However, I couldn’t find any by searching the web. Maybe I am missing the right phrases for an effective search. 

Maybe someone knows what kind of software I am looking for?",0,1,2019-04-17 05:31:25

I've learned the basics of C# up to Classes (touching on Classes) and MySQL basics for backend database management obviously (up to connecting through C# to the DB and manipulating the DB for results back in the console in Visual Studio). The degree also includes CMS systems, MongoDB, User Interface design, and a lot more.

However I am very much struggling to learn apparently very simple things without a *LOT* of help from the teacher of my current MySQL class as well as mentors that are in the class when the teacher is unavailable. I am generally struggling with applying the lessons to the questions and I have been since the first C# class a few months ago. I am actually very much liking working with DBs over C# and was considering furthering my career path in that, but my latest assignment has shown me that I still only understand the very basics of DB management/C# and I am unable to apply the lessons to the assignments mentally.

I've had one person helping my throughout my schooling, an online friend, but he's currently indisposed for an unknown amount of time, and how much I have come to rely on him is really showing now. (Never gave me the answers straight, but he was always there to clarify things in layman's terms, etc). I typically pay him after each class for his help as well.

I always attempt to google my questions but a lot of this is ""unique"" to the assignment, so I'm always at a loss... and don't get me started on reading documentation with syntax and stuff that I don't understand in general. I can read some of it, but a lot of it is lost on me.

My question here is: Should I cut my losses and drop out and just focus on trying to make as much money as I can to pay off my student loans that I've taken out for school, or continue to just bother people for help? Am I just not wired correctly for this sort of thing, as much as I wish I was? 

I am *REALLY* enjoying learning these new things, but it's like I need someone there all the time because I'm apparently not ""learning"" per se, is how it feels, because I can't apply the lessons to the homework no matter how much I rewatch the lesson videos over and over again.

Problem is my new boss is being somewhat vague about what exactly my duties are going to be. When I asked what I should study up on for my first day on the job, he told me to, and I quote 'don't worry about it, go party for a week before your first day, we'll teach you everything you need to know!'

He's super friendly and despite me pressing specific details he would not tell me. He did let me know I would start off doing some QA with the multitude of Web Systems they develop.

I know they're systems were done with Javascript/C#.NET which I have a good base knowledge of.
I really just want to spend the next week I have studying up on what I should know to be a good employee on the first day.
I have afterall read horror stories of junior developers coming in on their first day and nuking databases (not saying this would happen but I would like to be prepared!).

Any insights on what I should spend my time on studying? I have the next week and a half before my first day and I want to use this time effectively!

It recursively calls itself by splitting the array in half and calling itself on both halves, but then it still has to compare the two sorted arrays.

I'm currently working on a project and need a little direction. The project is essentially controlling a bot from a ""command center"". The bot is really low level and I'm sending all sorts of information through UART communication &amp; its wifi card. 

Originally, I was using putty for sending and receiving information. It was simple, put 192.168.1.1 for the host, drop the port number, baud rate, and another thing or two and it could communicate efficiently and accurately. The sensor data would come in and display line by line, and I could send characters back to the bot like I needed just by inputting. 

The thing is, I need to build a proper command center now though, and that involves live data visualization, ect... Charts for object detection, color underneath me, ect... Thus, instead of just seeing those numbers transmitted back to putty, I need to be able to manipulate/graph them live.

I'm trying to do the visualization in python (already wrote stuff that can do it live), and figured I could easily send and receive the data with some python libraries too. The thing is, I've never worked with networking stuff before, and I'm learning python as I go. 

I have no ideas what tools or libraries would potentially abstract the most of this for me. Originally, I was really, really hoping to just be able to use pyserial. It links up with the baud rate super well, the data comes in live, I don't have to worry about losing stuff. Then I realized yea I need to do this over a TCP connection, which I know nothing about haha. Now, I'm giving it a go with sockets, but I have no idea whats going on, cause I didn't know what a socket was until today. I was able to receive a packet, but I need everything to be transferred effectively and fluidly, which doesn't seem very easy if I'm involving tons more packets. 

Thoughts? I was told to give socket.makefile().readline() or something of the like, which I'll be trying soon after this.

Are any of the modern web languages / frameworks particularly well-suited for creating one-page dashboards? *e.g.* Imagine, waking up and entering how many hours of sleep you got, updating a calories counter throughout the day, or tapping a button to say, ""I worked out today!"" or ""I had a beer today."" And then later, building out some views or graphs.

I'm a backend dev interested in learning a new web technology, but don't have too much free time. So, I'm trying my best to limit features and make choices that ultimately save time. For example,

* I want it to be accessible from any device, but it does **not** have to be responsive / mobile. (It's not a focus I want to spend time perfecting or debugging.)
* I want to integrate a mature undo / redo library. (I don't want to have to write SQL to fix a database row every time I fat-finger something.)
* I *prefer* it to be Javascript-based (if there even is a thing that isn't?) so that I can draw from a multitude of libraries when it comes to building views and graphs.
* I *prefer* it to be hosted (and am willing to pay) so I don't have to spend time on administration. But, not a dealbreaker. I'm able to rent a VPS, install Nginx, etc.

I began a React tutorial, but I felt like it might be overkill for what I want to accomplish. Or, should I continue? I really like what I'm hearing about Rust, but it doesn't seem mature enough to be painless.

But im curious about what the simplest way to go about it, would be, as Ive not touched programming in quite awhile.

Have studied Python and C as part of a class for a year, and had a minor project in Perl, but other than that, my programming knowledge is quite limited. And maybe it could be doable in Excel?

to make it very simple, i would imagine that i have 3 tables (could be in separate documents), with a list of entries. Then I have some sort of process that picks one random entry from each of the tables, and then displays it in a spesific order.

example:

In a game called Mutant Year zero, you have a grid map, and when the players in the game move from one square to another, several rolls have to be made in order to figure out if the area is urban or rural, what sort of building or environment is there, how much radiation is in the area, if artifacts can be found there, what sort of threats can be found and what sort of mood that affects the area.

So, I would appriciate a few tips on what the easiest way to make a program that does all of these table-rolls for me, instead of having to spend a few minutes each time it needs to be checked.",6,1,2019-04-22 02:11:48

edit number 2: I changed the dot operators in the compareString function to be arrow operators: -&gt; 

it flipped the list [upside down](https://i.imgur.com/YRxPFmi.png) instead of sorting anything. Equally confused but at least it's a new problem to lead me somewhere

Big boy EDIT 3: I changed all the comparison signs with strcmp, result is still the same. Here's a paste of my code as requested: https://textuploader.com/1dar2

Final edit: I got the program working at 99% capacity. The first entry on the original list has a few random characters in front of it, but otherwise it is sorted. [Final output](https://i.imgur.com/5s6a3Js.png)",4,0,2019-04-22 17:08:15

165,bh4vg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/bh4vg0/dynamic_c_mystery_recovering_legacy_code/,Dynamic C Mystery - Recovering Legacy Code,"I have a bit of a mystery on my hands:

I was handed an integrated control device whose original developers left our working group long before my time. I have been asked to port the exact functionality of this control device to a modern platform (like Arduino) so that my system can be a drop in replacement for the existing controller.

Only one problem: the source code is gone! All that I have to work with is the compiled firmware on the device. Thankfully, I have been able to force the microcontroller (an old Rabbit 2000 series) to regurgitate the contents of its flash modules and convert the resulting dump into a .bin file. I also know that the development language is Dynamic C (a C-like language for Rabbit microcontrollers).

I am struggling with the decompilation process. I theoretically know all of the information required to decompile, but I have not been able to find a decompiler from the binary to Dynamic C. I know the exact processor and microcontroller that the code was run on, and I even have the IDE.

At the end of the day, I need to learn the handshaking and data transmission routine between the controller and the many external devices that the current system uses so that I can mirror the controller on a different platform. I tried sniffing network packets, but there is far too much traffic between these devices to determine a meaningful procedure (as far as I know).   

Does anyone have advice on decompiling Dynamic C from a .bin file? Thanks!",11,1,2019-04-25 01:19:37

167,bh6mps,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/bh6mps/trying_to_automatically_generate_passwords_for/,Trying to automatically generate passwords for every combination possible in an array.,"I have a video game, each possible save state should have a password that lets you load it.  
Since there's potentially thousands or tens of thousands of possibilities, instead of me manually creating passwords for each possible order of this array. 

Instead I'd want an algorithm that does it for me.  

For example. 

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]  
Is ADWF  
[0, 2, 3, 4, 1] 
Is EETU  

I don't care about the letters being a specific order, just that they match up with every possible save state.  

That way when a player chooses to ""save"" the game.  They also get a passcode, this allows them to load that state on any other game, without needing the memory file of that save.

I'm not really asking people to do my work for me. I am just wondering what algorithm or logic is required for me to do this.

Edit: Nvm I figured it out I'm dumb. I just iterate through every possibility, and simply have for each iteration, to randomly generate text that hasn't been used before.  And save that text inside its own key value)  {[0, 2, 3, 4, 1] = EETU}  Upon entering a value on the password screen, I will query to find a matching value and then return the key it belongs to.",7,1,2019-04-25 05:37:35

First off, how do I have a separate Git Hub repository or whatever for different websites? I went to GitHub and it seems like my uploads from both websites I've been ""git push origin"" ing are under the same name. How can I go about transferring what I have into a new project/repository name to make sure they stay separate?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, I have two questions regarding their feasibility.   

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is it possible to create a website with customisable components? If one component is not desired to be closed out and another one takes its place or the rest of the components rescale to fit in a nicer way?  

&amp;#x200B;

2. Creating a component that will allow you to login to another website (example: facebook or twitter), and it portrays the component window as a smaller page for the website they login to. 

 

Are these features possible to make?

&amp;#x200B;

If so, are there any websites that portray these features.   Appreciate any help! ",3,0,2019-04-08 07:32:31

I am working on a continuously growing big project (currently \~200 ppl) and we are still writing and reviewing documents in word docs and pdfs which makes it really hard to keep them up to date and it is also hard to synchronize who is allowed to work on the document, because later on it makes it hard to merge the versions together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you use special tools on your project for this purpose? 

I am hoping maybe some of you can suggest me something to make our life easier and I can suggest to my management to consider it. Security and licensing fee is a very important aspect here.

How can I choose X (the step) such that my list covers a wide range of different types of numbers? For instance I wouldnt want to pick X=an even number, because then I'd never test an odd number.

A little horrified, I downloaded it and saw my information -- my phone number, current address, email, new address -- inside this CSV with a few others.

The application was developed by a third party (not the moving company itself).  What should I do with this information?  Should I report it to the company that developed it?  There are comments in the code from 2010, so I'm not sure if it's still maintained.  Should I report it to the moving company?
