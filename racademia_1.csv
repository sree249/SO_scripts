Her publications, grants, student reviews and service are looking good.

However, the school culture isn't a good fit and she would like to snag a position elsewhere. So she is getting her materials together and doesn't know what to do about current references. Obviously, she doesn't want anyone to get wind of her looking for work elsewhere, as she might need to stay put at this job.

She does have letters of support for the upcoming contract renewal from faculty that observed her teaching, which would be perfect for the application, but those can't be used, correct?

She has old reference letters but the application wants current...thanks for advice on this and the situation overall--it seems precarious but I hear it is common. I don't know how to help her to advance with grace and care.

edit: after reading the first two responses--and thanks so much--she's thinking the smartest approach is to be granted renewal and then resign before looking for another position? She doesn't have anyone who would write a substantive letter that wouldn't be totally shocked that she's interested in leaving. Plus, she would have to ask for the letter right before renewal deliberations--how would they recommend renewal knowing she wants to leave? what a conundrum!",9,12

* Someone with 22 first author papers **one** year after thesis? I’m not kidding 
* Someone who graduated in my year and has 13 first author with 186 total and 6000 citations total

7,ak8r65,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/ak8r65/academic_fraud_discovery_advice_needed/,Academic fraud discovery - advice needed,"tl;dr Academic fraud from 2010 was used to acquire millions in charitable donations from the parents of sick children, in addition to grant funds, which were then spent on pointless experiments and/or used to build up the careers of the fraudsters. I have no faith in reporting this to the university as they have swept previous complaints under the rug. Looking for advice on the best way to bring this to light to ensure the fraudsters are removed from their positions while hopefully keeping the lab itself intact as they have ample equipment (paid for by the charity) and skills to succeed if they can get competent leadership. (In Australia)

&amp;#x200B;

Identifiable details are little vague for obvious reasons.

I was a PhD student in a small lab (4 people when I started, 12 when I finished) dedicated to finding a cure for a childhood disease, it was located within a hospital. I chose the lab specifically as it was funded by a very successful charity group and I thought this meant it would be focused more on results, and less focused on papers/grants. From the beginning there were ethical, transparency, and expertise issues. The lab head and his right-hand-man were not very knowledgeable about the topics they were meant to be experts in - they were able to use all the right words with enough confidence to convince a lay person, but within the lab were useless to get any advice from. Their time was mostly spent rubbing shoulders with the 'right-people' in other institutions and getting their names out there at international conferences where they presented lab members work. This did not prevent them from claiming credit for all work produced.

Me, being a PhD student, who had research experience in a different discipline (Computer Science) dismissed these concerns as 'they must know more than me' and 'this must be how it is in medical research', so I just carried on. Over time it became more and more obvious the lab management were misleading the charity as to how relevant of the work they were funding was to the charity's main cause - curing a particular childhood disease. These funds were provided with no scientific oversight beyond what the lab management provided. This concerned me greatly as part of our job was meeting the donors, often the desperate parents of very ill children. It spurred me to push the lab management for details on 'how' the experiments they were conducting were actually of any use to the development of a cure for the disease. I was met with hand-waving and non-answers so I kept pushing - i.e. 'I know *x* &amp; *y* but they are irrelevant because of *z*, so how does the experiment *actually* contribute any progress to a cure?'. This was met with significant hostility and it was made clear that I had to accept their non-answers or not be a part of the lab.

I was worried about making a complaint as the charity that funded the lab had spent a lot of volunteer time building up the reputation and contacts needed to pull in the almost one million dollars a year to fund the lab, and I didn't want to damage them or their hard work. I arranged to speak to the head of the charity covertly, and laid out my main concerns - namely that the lab had potential, but was being thwarted at every turn by the management. The charity head confided in me that they had harboured their own concerns about the lab management for a long time but had hoped the lab head would retire allowing a new head to come in and remove the 2IC. He also said he has spoken to some other members of the lab who had also raised concerns.

A few months later the charity announced they would no longer be funding the lab (after more than 8 years), and would instead be funnelling their charitable donations through an existing competitive grants system. The public reason for this was that 'they had been so successful in raising funds they needed to diversify'.

Now that the charity was free from the lab I spoke with other team members and compiled a long list of complaints including: misuse of funds, bullying, misleading the animal ethics department, lack of supervision, etc and spoke to the University's ethics department about it. They assured me it was a valid complaint that I was able to back up with documentation, so I went ahead with it. A few months later I get a response from the University that the complaint had been found unwarranted, and they addressed each complaint individually dismissing the direct misuse of grant funds as 'repeated financial oversights' and dismissing the lack of supervision without even talking to anyone in the lab. I feel they very much swept it all under the rug.

Shortly before the the university's ruling another member of the lab - a very skilled post-doc who was a recent addition to the team - discovered that the 2010 results of the two seminal publications for the lab were faked. Misplaced start and stop codons in dna sequences meant the positive results they claimed were impossible. To be completely sure the post-doc secretly sequenced the original dna sequences used in the papers (which were still in the freezer), and repeated parts of the experiments using a corrected sequence as a positive control. We can only assume that the lab heads were not getting the results they wanted, and lacking the skills to properly diagnose the problem they faked the results. This caused millions of dollars of research funding, and millions of dollars donated from the desperate parents of sick children to go into the hands of two incompetent scientists who proceeded to flush it down the proverbial toilet for 9 years until a post-doc discovered the reason there had been no results over this time.

The post-doc in question took the discovery to the lab head around August last year - who apparently 'turned white' - but has since pretended the conversation never took place and seemingly has no intention on retracting the papers.

I have no faith in taking the evidence of the academic fraud to the university due to their sweeping-under-the-rug of my previous complaint, but am unsure of what to do now. I would appreciate any advice. The post-doc who discovered the fraud is still employed in the lab and as it is her only source of income she is concerned about coming forward before she secures a new job. I feel compelled to prevent more money being conned out of desperate people, and more grant funds not being awarded to real scientists, but am uneasy about going public without being able to ensure the careers of the innocent post-docs and students in the lab.

This is all in Australia.

After graduating I spent 3 years in a job unrelated to physics.  I would like to get back to a physics career but I have a couple of big obstacles.

First of all my degree sucks(2:2). I was always good at physics/math, winning lots of national competitions during school but at uni I fucked around too much. I set a goal of getting a masters degree and did minimal effort to get there, I spent last 3 years regretting that.

Second, I was an international student in UK. I was lucky enough to have my family found my studies but that is not an option anymore. I come from a low income European country and do not have much faith in the education in my country. I would ideally continue somewhere in the EU but founding could be a problem.

I am not sure what my options are now. Going straight for PhD seems unreasonable as both my degree is bad and my knowledge has decreased a lot since graduation.

I feel bit hopeless given the issues I listed, do you have any advice to me?

Since then we've travel the world together, fell in love numerous times with each other, got married and most importantly somehow barely managed to make our marriage survive her getting a Ph.D. All this time I accepted the fact that everything else in my life would come second to hers until she got her PhD. There was the constant moving, not allowing myself to get too close to people to make deep friendships because I knew that there was a chance at the end of the academic year I might never see these people again. I haven't been able to lock down a career or an education path of my own. Because there's always the chance we'll be moving somewhere, I'm forced to work menial jobs sometimes two full-time jobs at a time. 2 years ago I was working a nine-to-five job Monday through Thursday Friday and then on Friday night I just wouldn't sleep and work my second job until 9 or 10 in the morning on Saturday, get a few hours rest and work all night long Saturday to Sunday for a total of 70 plus hours a week. I did this for almost 3 years. I've basically put my own life on hold for the past 12 years because I truly adore her. I also figured that when she got her Ph.D everything would become a little less stressful and we could have a semi-normal life again and maybe I or things that were important in my life wouldn't have to come second as much. And maybe even the family we've always talked about. Unfortunately this just doesn't seem to be the case. There's more stress, even less time for us, and I feel like I just don't matter at all. A few weeks ago I came to the realization that I had suppressed so many parts of my personality and who I am, my own needs or who I want to be, that I just got in the car and drove to the nearest hospital because I just couldn't handle it. I was so depressed that I was terrified I might do something stupid if someone else didn't intervene. I've tried talking to her about everything, I've even had some friends try and intervene and talk to her. I know she understands the concept of what I'm going through or what I have gone through these past years but I don't think she honestly is capable of having that compassion, whether it's due to her stress or something else going on with her. We've talked about marriage counseling and I think that will help however since she's on the complete opposite side of the map from me right now the next time we'll see each other is well over a month or so away. I know spouses and partners of academics need to be cactuses but even cactuses need water every once in awhile.",15,45

A few weeks back, I received a call asking if I wanted to come in for an interview (the candidate that beat me out was moving on). Position has been open since summer, they haven’t had time to fill it. They did not post the position. Went to an informal interview. Submitted references the next day (yesterday).

Communication has been spotty through the whole process. Partly, I believe, due to losing their admin person (budget cuts). It sounds like the department has been overwhelmed by having to cover the admin duties (they just received the ok to reinstate the position).

Today, I receive an email from someone who was unable to attend the informal interview saying, “I’m so-and-so, welcome! Can you come help with this group activity in a few weeks?”

15,ajns40,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/ajns40/how_involved_is_your_supervisor/,How involved is your supervisor?,"Hi all, 

I'm a bit worried about how my relationship with my supervisor is turning out, was wondering if you think this is normal. Also just want to moan a little bit. 

Background: Worked with this supervisor on my master's thesis. We worked pretty well together, I genuinely enjoyed his approach, the amount of feedback, and all the guidance he provided. As a result, my master's thesis turned out really well and we are getting it published. 

Obviously wanted to continue working with him, so we bounced some ideas off each other and came up with a research question, for which I wrote a proposal and he then edited. I didn't mind the edits because at that point they were mostly just directing me to develop certain ideas, but I still wrote it myself. 

Applied for several scholarships, he started insisting that I send him all the applications for editing. I don't mind, but he's sending them back HEAVILY edited. He basically rewrites all of them himself, leaving only my ""ands"" and ""buts"" in, everything else is crossed out and replaced. I got the funding, and would have otherwise been thrilled about this, but I just don't feel like it is me who got it, more like he got it for me.  

Now he's just emailed me putting me in touch with another student of his. He basically met that other student and told him all about my project and wants that student to get involved. Of course I had to agree that he puts us in touch, because he's already talked to that student, but I just wish he'd suggested this to me first so that I at least had an illusion of agency. 

To clarify, the PhD doesn't start until September, I'm doing other academic work at another institution at the moment, but he wants me to start working on this now (I agree, why waste time)

&amp;#x200B;

What bothers me is all the heavy editing and him putting me in touch with the other student. I don't feel like I have any autonomy anymore, and feel like I'm a child in one of those bicycles with a parent handle, being taken for a ride by my supervisor who goes ""See? You're doing it yourself, well done!"". I guess this is just my own insecurities, but this whole situation seriously bothers me. I do want his guidance, but at this point I feel totally incompetent, as though I won't succeed unless he improves my work or just does it for me. 

Is this normal? Is the first year of PhD basically blindly following your supervisor? Do you get to be more and more independent as you progress? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR I feel like I'm just doing whatever my supervisor tells me to, or he just does things for me. No autonomy whatsoever. Is this really okay? ",7,7

I'll be beginning my PhD program this year and I wanted to know what sort of view people/departments have about Narratology. I have a very strong interest in Narratives and have been reading a lot of Narratology, trying to come up with a research proposal that works with narratives. Talking to a few people I get sense that it's not well-received. But this seems to be from their experiences taking undergrad classes in the subject that focused on Classical Narratology - from which the entire field has moved on. The contemporary debates are far removed from the days of Genette. The professors I've spoken to are more interested in a basic understanding of Narrative theory that's suited to their immediate scholarly/research needs and left me only more confused as to the ""state"" of narratology.

So what I'm asking is, as a scholar who wishes to work in the field of Narratology and possibly dedicate a great deal of my life to it, what should I know about the field before I enter it? How are Narratologists seen in Lit/English departments?  
Is it a viable career option?

And if anyone has some familiarity with the area, what are some of the more contemporary debates in this field? Where should I look to situate my research?

Recruiting in progress: [https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/364125](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/364125)

**More details:**  
A-WEAR is a four year (2019-2022) H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network (ITN)/European Joint Doctorate (EJD) 4 bringing together five beneficiaries and 12 partner organizations from **Finland, Czech republic, Italy, Romania, and Spain**, with the aim of educating, supervising, and training **15 young ambitious** **and** **creative researchers** to face the future challenges in smart wearables and wireless computing and enhance their career prospects by training them in a multi-sector cross-country environment and teaching them to think globally.

The emerging market of wearables is expected to grow exponentially in the near future, driven by the sales increase of smart clothes, watches, and eyeglasses. The future wearables are likely to be heterogeneous, operating on batteries, sun power or human motion, and endowed with smart functions. They will co-operate in a decentralized manner with each other and will be able to reach various interconnected software and applications. The main stream wearable-based architecture has been applied so far in wellbeing industries, such as eHealth or ambient assisted living, which might also reduce the costs for care and guarantee a healthy independent live in the forthcoming older society. As the digitalisation and data-based economy are growing, the exploitation potential of the wearables can easily be expected to increase. Key wearables stakeholder groups in the future are also smart cities, comprising intelligent building industry and infrastructure, energy-efficient smart grid sector, public e-Services, and smart transport. Motivated by the opportunities that next-generation wearable intelligence is expected to provide, the mission of A-WEAR action is to cross-disciplinarily create new architectures, open-source software and frameworks for dynamic wearable ecosystems, with distributed localization and privacy constraints. We aim at building new joint/double European doctoral programmes to train a new generation of young researchers in order to be aware of, to cope with, and to disseminate to a large audience the vulnerabilities and the corresponding solutions of the communication and positioning through wearables. The impact of A-WEAR will be to enhance the future social well-being, to contribute to an easy living, effective and enjoyable work, and to offer new solutions to the challenges of violation of privacy by communication and positioning through wearables and to the need of applying the right of the ownership to one’s data.

Hey there fellow academics.

I have allowed myself to be in the position of building and delivering the lectures for an upper level undergraduate course as a sessional lecturer. Trouble is, although perhaps I am technically qualified, I really feel pretty much at sea in terms of what the hell it is I'm supposed to be teaching. The topic is broadly in my field, but I have no direct experience or knowledge of this particular sub-discipline, just a smattering of factoids leftover from coursework past. I also have never taught a course in its entirety and thus do not have that kind of experience to fall back on.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as though I have rather unwisely put myself in this position, and that I'd be much better off to conceal myselfin some underground cavern until May.

Has anyone else here been similarly stupid in their past? If so, did you experience a large weight of stress and feelings of gross incompetence? Did they pass in short order or follow you around for the whole term?

I'm a full time employee but am considering doing a MS part time. The deadline for the fall semester is in 2 months, so I'd ideally like to ask my recommender to write and submit a letter now, but I have a couple of concerns:

1. I may end up moving away from this job for a couple of reasons. If I get admitted but then end up moving (because of personal reasons or for a better job offer), would it create a lot of awkwardness between me and my recommender, or would they understand it as life happening? I'd obviously like to be respectful and keep a good relationship, and of course I may still want to apply to other grad schools in the future (say a few years down the line)
2. Does it matter in any way if I may also want to use this rec letter for PhD recommendations later on? Should I just communicate this to the professor? My areas of interest are applied math / stats / CS, and the professor is a math professor, so I'm assuming that they can write one letter of recommendation that should work for all three of those subject areas (and for both MS and PhD programs). Is this thinking correct?

Two things are currently giving me problems with confidence though:

Firstly, impostor syndrome. Not only with regard to the linguistics, but also because I've never been to India and am not in a position to do so either. This makes me feel I'd be being some kind of armchair director, disconnected from my subject matter and out of touch.

Secondly, I'm white and British, so very aware of my privilege, and India is a very complicated place with a complicated history. How can I possibly do justice to that when I've never even set foot in the country? I don't want to do a disservice to them academically or in any way, but what if my linguistic opinions are opposed to a native Indian's linguistic opinions? Why would I know better? What if my eurocentric views subconsciously hinder me?

All of this makes me wonder if this area is too personal or too sensitive to work on, but there must be other Western scholars who do not succumb to orientalism. It seems a shame to not focus on what I love for fear of causing offence or being wrong because of subconsciously inherited cultural biases. I just want to be respectful and have academic integrity.

I have no research experience, and not sure where to start in terms of obtaining i️t but I plan on asking counselors and former professors for help on that matter. 

Currently have a 3.8 GPA. My only concern is that graduate programs in this field typically require a ton of math. Other than taking AP Statistics and AP Calc BC (which covers until taylor series) in high school, I haven’t taken purely math courses in undergraduate.

Here are some relevant courses I have taken/am taking though: Microeconomics for Business, Macroeconomics for Business, Applied Business Statistics, Business Finance, Investments. I also plan on taking Corporate Financial Strategy next semester.

My concern is I don’t really have many elective class spots left for my senior year to take all the required math courses (Calc II, Calc III, Linear Algebra, other stats courses) + take courses I want to take in the finance/econ field (i.e intermediate economic theory, stats for economists, econometrics).

What line of coursework would you say is very crucial to get into a top Finance/econ program. Should I take math courses next year or more finance/econ? Very confused, need some guidance. I would much rather take classes in Finance/Econ but then I’d have graduated with far too weak of a mathematical base. Would programs consider me if i were to take those math classes at a CC after i graduated?

**TL;DR: how do you use referencing software? Do you manually edit citations in-text? Help!**

Hi all

I’ve reached my wits’ end with referencing software and wondered if you fine folks could help. 

How do you all use referencing software on a daily basis? 

I’m about 1/3-1/2 the way through my PhD thesis (Forensic Psychology) and have been using mendeley for this time. I save references and citations, (but don’t keep a folder structure) and then use the MS Word plugin to cite in the document.   
 

For Psychology this is typically ‘name (date)’: Smith (2005), said biscuits are good. The citation manager presents the citations as ‘(name, date)’ however. 

To get to name-date formatting I therefore manually edit the field in the word doc to meet my needs. This somewhat breaks the link to library (citations won’t update) but retains the ability to create a bibliography etc.  
 

Is there another way to do name-date in-text citations I’m missing? 

Is this a reasonably effective way to use referencing software? 

I feel like I am not using the software ‘correctly’ – it all feels a bit ‘workaround’. 

I’m trying to move over to Zotero from Mendeley, (due to the latter starting to lock down and encrypt all data locally) but in doing so I’ll lose all the manual edits to citations I made in Mendeley, (they will be overwritten to ‘(name, date)’ so it looks like I’m going to have to trawl through 70+pages of literature review and manually update all references. Arg. 

Thanks in advance to anyone who has any advice!

I'm currently a Master's student at an Australian Uni and have some questions about the (formal and informal) necessary skills and requirements to get into Oxbridge.

For a variety of reasons, I didn't do particularly well in my undergrad degree, but believe I am doing very well in my current degree. It's a Master's by Research, so it' consists only of a 40- 50,000 word thesis, no coursework or classes. My supervisor is quite famous in their field, and happens to be an ex- Oxford student. They still have some connections to Oxbridge/ highly renown  academic in the field, though I'm not sure how relevant this is. Crucially, I feel, my supervisor believes in my abilities (they once told me I'd have ""no issues getting into Oxford, for example""), speaks to me as an equal rather than a subordinate, and likes me personally, which I believe could have an effect on my career path. 

The problem is that I so far have gotten ZERO scholarships, and haven't yet published anything. I plan on publishing 3 pieces (chapters that can later be published as independent articles), but the scholarship issue is stressing me out quite a lot. One of my close friends has been awarded two fairly prestigious scholarships, has helped me out with one application (I used her winning application as a very rough template, and truly believe I easily lived up to the standards of her application), from which I was knocked back. I know of multiple other students in my cohort who have been awarded scholarships and cannot for the life of me figure out how or why. I'm obviously biased, but I know that some of these individuals arent particularly clever or great writers, yet they're succeeding in ways I'm not (for what it's worth, I've read the work of many of the individuals I'm commenting on). Also, the people who have read my work seem just as baffled by my inability to get any scholarships so far. I hate to toot my own horn, but I'm a clever and lateral thinker (especially in comparison to the vast majority of fellow students), a good researcher/ writer, and have a strong work ethic. And then there's the snowball effect- the more scholarships you have under your belt, the more highly respected you'll be regarded and more seriously considered for further awards. Or that's at least my impression. I'm trying not to get too disheartened and am still going to continue to apply for scholarships, obviously, but this sucks. I was wondering if anyone had experienced anything similar/ if anyone had any good advice for improving scholarship applications? And yes, I know each scholarship is different etc, but I'm in desperate need of any words of wisdom.

And back to my original question- has anyone here gotten into Oxbridge? How seriously do they take into account scholarship awards? Do positive references from academics personally known by staff members of the institution/ your potential supervisor make any difference? What else do they consider when weighing up your application?

I liked Mendeley the best because it has a nice PDF reader embedded.

Now, I'm leaving Mendeley largely due to the late updates for the latest OS version on Mac, no support for Google Docs, and perennial bugs on MS Word; Mendeley might have been good for reading, but not writing.

I'd like to get your suggestions in choosing between Zotero, F1000workspace, Paperpile, and any other one that works well with Google Docs. Free software will be good, but I don't mind paid versions if it's worth.
