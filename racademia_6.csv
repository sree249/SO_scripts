&amp;#x200B;

This is something that has been in the back of my head for some time, but now that I have a concrete example, I would like to ask to more experienced researchers how do they do this. I'm a young researcher in neuroscience, and I wanted to write a blog post about conscious and automatic attention, and the process of automating parts of complex processes to free cognitive load.

&amp;#x200B;

As such, a particular attentional model (Normal and Shallice) comes to mind. The thing is, I studied this model almost 3 years ago, back in my masters, and I would like to update myself in case there are additions to this model to better explain this particular phenomenon, but what would be a good way of doing so? I hope the concreteness of the example does not in the way of the general question of how to update oneself.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much in advance!",4,7
1,c1owk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/c1owk4/collaboration_in_academia/,Collaboration in Academia,"Hi Everyone,

I'm currently struggling with collaboration in my research organization. 

I have a number of older colleagues that I formerly collaborated with, but as the years have gone by, there is zero benefit for me to do so - they show up to discussions, add comments here and there, but don't actively do any work. It's partly the fact that they are incompetent with computers (which I have mild sympathies about) but also that they just can't be troubled to put in the time needed to even do traditional R&amp;D (theoretical work) where a computer is unnecessary. They all still use graduate students to ""get work done"" (I am guilty of the same) but I'm still keen to do work myself and not strictly delegate.

Am I being a prima donna in that I don't want to collaborate with such one sided arrangements, and is their argument of ""they did their time"" sufficient for me to accept their minimal contributions?",2,4

I have also never had a female teacher congratulate me for the highest score on a test or a quiz, or for doing an exceptional job on an assignment, or ask if I can speak to them about a book during office hours (happens frequently with male professors). Additionally, female teachers never seem to like me. I think this is partly because I am quiet and soft spoken, so they think I am weak. I have been told to be more ""assertive"" by two separate female teachers and one spanish woman who taught french really hated me for some reason. When we learned the word ""witch"" in french, she pointed to me and said ""like her"" and played it off as a joke, but she was really rude and unfriendly so we were not friends who joked together. She also suggested that should not take a higher level of french, despite the fact she gave me a B in the class (even though I aced all the exams and she gave me a low grade on a subjective project). Meanwhile, male professors speak to me in a baby voice most of the time, so I guess they don't take me seriously since I look young and I am quiet. They seem to think I seem nice or feel sorry for me- I don't know. All I know is, I've never received below an A- in a class with a male professor, yet I have received many Bs and even a C with female professors. Almost half of them seem to dislike me as well. One even told me I would never be a nurse with my ""mouse-like"" temperament (when I was still considering nursing). Not to be sexist, since I am also female, but this is my experience.",14,0

I have been casually interested in Philosophy since my teenage years and reading on it quite a bit for the past almost decade.

About three years ago I started really zoning into a topic wrt my reading and thinking and as I got more into it I really wanted to go into a grad program for Philosophy to pursue this more academically. I found a grad program and started talking to their Director of Admissions. I took a couple of courses on the side at a nearby college, did well, and got recommendation letters. I applied to the grad program and got accepted to start in the Fall. 

In parallel, in the past few months I’ve found myself in the middle of a whirlwind of other really interesting topics, some closely related to my original area of interest, some only loosely related. 

The thing is that the people I’ve been talking to over the last several months are really intelligent, far better read than I am, and have mental models of many of these topics that have been making me half doubt my own prior mental models. 

More importantly, I’ve started doubting my own intellectual capacity and ability to pursue an academically rigorous discipline.

That brings me to my crossroads. What happened? I was so sure this is what I wanted and now I feel disoriented and unsure of what I’m doing. Should I just ignore all these other new areas of interest that have come into my life all of a sudden and return to the original area of interest and focus on just that?

I still really want to pursue the grad program, but I don’t know what to study or focus on. And I don’t know how to get through this comparison of self to others, which consistently results in self doubt. 

Appreciate any advice/guidance!

I'm close to being 30 but have been out of university for about 5 years. The last degree was a research based Masters, but I've recently been thinking about going back to do a PhD as I love research and the idea of teaching sounds interesting to me as well. 

I also have been doing some research for career paths and frankly haven't seen many examples of top-notch professors and researchers who left academia for a significant period before going back to do a PhD. Most (99%) of them did their MS and PhDs together, followed by a Post Doc or something else. For context, my area of specialty is Electrical Engineering - in Signal Processing, Pattern Recognition, and Data Science. 

Does any of you know of any examples of the opposite? Alternatively, do you have any insights as to why transitioning to a doctorate so late in the game might have its problems?",12,11

I’m 26 and have just completed the first year of a Natural Sciences BSc degree with the Open University (UK), a distance learning university.

I have already a Bachelor of Laws (good ranked UK uni) and Master in Management from a similarly ranked (~top 10 uni) in France.

After working in business and law I found it wasn’t what I wanted to do, and remembering my old dream to become a zoologist, I decided to save money and pursue a Open University distance Bachelor in Science, with a view to volunteer and work in conservation at the same time internationally whilst studying towards my degree.

At the same time, I can’t help but wonder if, when I apply to a graduate programme for science, admissions might see my Open University degree differently compared to applicants with more conventional backgrounds.

Do you think admissions will have a problem with my background? Thinking of applying to Masters in Ecology/Zoology with a view to working in research.

One liked it, the other hated it. The editor decided to reject. I've done some reading on when it is appropriate to appeal an editor's decision to reject and many essays on the matter refer to evidence of bias on the part of a reviewer. I'm not sure if this is bias or what, but the reviewer who hated it seemed to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of the research. They approached the paper from their own discipline (human geography) and didn't appear capable of understanding that the paper was not meant to contribute to human geography. They applied standards of scrutiny to the methods that were totally inappropriate given the purpose of the paper and the nature of the results. They also admitted to not even reading past the results section (to not bothering to read the discussion section or conclusion). 

Is that worth appealing? Or can I trust that the editor would have read the paper too and been the arbiter since one review was positive and the other negative? I also have no publication history, so maybe that played a part too.

Hello [chair],


I have an issue and the registrar directed me to you.

To make a long story short ill use bullets:


- In November 2018, i applied for graduation after fulfilling all requirements

- I've been receiving ""congrats grad"" emails and never received rejection emails

- I applied to jobs for about 7 months

- I found out i did not graduate, so many of those companies have likely blacklisted me for accidentally having a false resume

- I raised the graduation concern to Professor [X], [old academic advisor], and Professor [Y] (during a point of advisor transition)

- It was found that indeed fulfilled the requirement


However, now my grace period for my student loans is expired because i dropped full time status back in December 2018, despite only receiving my degree soon. I contacted FedLoan servicing, and they said if i can provide written proof of enrollment or proof of a special circumstance, then they can adjust my grace period. Could you perhaps do me the world of a favor and write such a document outlining this circumstance?

The problem is, my intended PhD supervisor was not approved by the scholarship board of directors. The directors insist I would have to change a supervisor if I were to take up their scholarship. 

I felt bad having troubled my intended supervisor because he had sat down with me to talk about the PhD projects and also linked with up with a co-supervisor. And after all that I have to break it to him that I’ve gotten the scholarship but he cannot be my supervisor. 

What would be the best way I could resolve this? If you’re the “intended supervisor” and this situation were to happen to you, what would you hope the student do first? How can I put these in word nicely? 

Thank you so much.. any advice is welcome..",3,4

Thing is, I'm not from the UK and have only the vaguest idea about whether teaching/researching there is substantially different from what I'm used to (namely, the French system). Exchanges with the University were laconic at best on this matter -- and the blurry perspective of Brexit raises questions concerning the employability of EEA nationals that they could not answer (not blaming them, who can?). On the one hand I feel qualified and interested and this would be an interesting career opportunity; on the other hand I'm not sure what I'm getting into and whether I should expect something completely different.

What should I know about the UK academic system, to hopefully make it through the interview? Should I worry about some things in particular (teaching hours, expectations, politics...)? Any advice you can give me would be hugely appreciated!",7,6

… I wrote back. 

&gt;Dear Nicholas,   
&gt;  
&gt;I see that Horizon Research Publishing is named on all the reputable lists of predatory journals. Of course, this is exactly what I expected after reading the flagrantly poor writing used to decorate your email to me and the likewise unimpressive HRP website.   
&gt;  
&gt;If your business model is conning enough people to be successful, you'll have no use for my reply. If you wish to con more people, however, you'll need a much better editor and a much better marketing team than you have now.   
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,   
&gt;  
&gt;lashend

Here’s how “Nicholas Wilson” replied … 

&gt;Dear lashend,  
Thanks for your suggestion.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Such a website cannot be maintained by only one person. Jeffrey Beall is just a librarian.   
Hence the maintenance and operation are beyond his ability. A similar forum can be created by   
any groups. Without the financial support, it is impossible for one website to appear on the   
first page of Google.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Many open-access publishers are listed there. The negative information may be removed if a   
large sum of money is paid by publishers.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;3. We're a non-profit organization. The publication fee varies from $200 to $290 for one   
manuscript accepted for publication. Compared with the publication fee charged by conventional   
publishers, it's cheap. Especially, a waiver policy is offered to many authors from low-income   
economies. Naturally, we are slandered by these powerful competitors. Nevertheless, thousands   
of articles have been released on over 1000 issues.  
For more information, please visit journal's homepage.  
[http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour\_charge.php?id=76](http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour_charge.php?id=76)  
  
&gt;  
&gt;4. To maintain the reputation of our journals, we have implemented a rigorous peer review. Only   
after clearing the peer review process is one manuscript accepted for publication. The   
editorial board for all journals has been posted online. With 55 journals and over 5000   
renowned experts, we are serving for over 100000 authors.  
e.g.:  
[http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour\_reviewers.php?id=76](http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour_reviewers.php?id=76);  
[http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour\_reviewers.php?id=93](http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour_reviewers.php?id=93);  
[http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour\_reviewers.php?id=96](http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour_reviewers.php?id=96);  
[http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour\_reviewers.php?id=95](http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour_reviewers.php?id=95);  
[http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour\_reviewers.php?id=21](http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour_reviewers.php?id=21);  
  
&gt;  
&gt;5. Based on the Jeffrey Beall's own assumptions, it's incredible that over 500 publishers in   
his list are predatory ones. What is his expertise remains unknown. Probably he is a genius in   
all academic disciplines like mathematics, physics, chemistry etc. All contents in Scholarlyoa   
are full of syntax errors. Even the name Scholarlyoa is a word created by his own imagination.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;6.Our journals have been indexed by some bibliographic databases (e.g. SCOPUS, EconLit, EBSCO   
A-Z, NSD - NorwegianCentre for Research Data, NLM Catalog, CABI full textetc).  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Five journals (Universal Journal of Mechanical Engineering,Universal Journal of Electrical and   
Electronic Engineering,Universal Journal of Educational Research, Civil Engineeringand   
Architecture, Mathematics and Statistics) have beenindexed by SCOPUS.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Four journals (Advances in Economics and Business, UniversalJournal of Accounting and Finance,   
Universal Journal ofIndustrial and Business Management, Universal Journal ofManagement) have   
been indexed by EconLit.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Besides, ""Linguistics and Literature Studies"" has been indexed by Linguistics Abstracts   
Online.""Universal Journal of Agricultural Research"" has been indexed by CABI full text and   
""Universal Journalof Public Health"" has been indexed by NLM Catalog.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;For more information, please visit the indexing page of the relevant journal.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, this person benefits from the following aspects:  
1. The negative information may be removed if a large sum of money is paid by publishers listed   
there.  
2. By defaming open access publishers, he will receive the reward from conventional publishers.  
3. We only focus on the assessment from governmental agencies and authoritative agencies in the   
industry. Any individual statements for commercial purposes will be ignored.

49,c21ymp,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/c21ymp/advice_on_rejecting_a_review_paper/,Advice on rejecting a review paper?,"I am a post doc and have only been asked to review 3 papers so far, all of which were primary studies that I thought had sound methodology, authors drew reasonable conclusions, etc so I recommended to accept with major/minor revisions. Recently, I was asked to review a paper and the title sounded interesting so I accepted. Upon receiving the entire document, I realized it was a review paper but I decided to still accept because I need to be able to do these things at some point and I was up to the challenge! 

However, this shit is awful.  There are two authors - a post doc and an MD. Clearly, the post doc is not a native English speaker (I know who the MD is and he is a well published native speaker), so its clear that the last author didn't even bother to read this before submitting. Some paragraphs (mainly the intro) are really well written, but most of it is riddled with typos and randomly organized, hard to interpret text. However, none of this is my big issue. All of this could be fixed with some proofreading and I don't feel people should be penalized for writing in a second language - I could never achieve that. 

My problem is that it is literally just a review of existing studies and random facts. Its like a textbook of random facts and at no point whatsoever do the authors postulate or synthesize anything. This would be a great bibliography resource for a new student or something, but the authors don't provide any interpretation, suggestions of a path forward, etc. So my gut is telling me to reject this paper, but I'm suffering from ""Who am ***I*** to reject these people"" and nervous about doing so. I'm trying to write up my review now and I don't know how to phrase things. Its not a structured review, just a place to write to the editor and a place to write to the authors. 

**Does anyone have suggestions for how I should phrase this rejection?** I feel like I really need to justify a rejection strongly, so I want to list 1) no synthesis of new ideas or information and 2) there are several other reviews recently published on this topic that did it way better, so these authors need to add something beyond what those other reviews did (which they did NOT). Is that enough to reject a review paper?",12,5

53,c4k8ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/c4k8ih/is_the_world_of_academia_right_for_me/,Is the world of Academia right for me?,"Hi all!

I am a recent graduate with a B. S. in psychology. I literally had my ceremony last weekend and now that all the graduation magic has died down I am still unemployed and confused about my career.

I am considering giving it my all, saving up for grad school, and then pursue that doctorate in Psychology I’ve been longing for since undergrad. 

I just don’t know if it’s the right path for me. Ever since I was a child, I have had a myriad of “dream jobs” and “career goals” that I just could not stick with. During my time in undergraduate school, I fell in love with the environment. I loved the campus. I loved the feeling of knowing you are surrounded by people striving towards the same goal. And the respect I had for my professors! 

I am just weary about this longing of mine to commit to graduate school. I had straight A’s up until my senior year—I had/been having a terrible bout of depression and just a lot of existential crises—and I’m just trying to recover from that. I’m also kind of weary as the last year or two of college I began to develop a more reclusive state as my depression set in. Losing my presidential position at an Honors fraternity, quitting my research position, and the decline of my connections to graduate students and professors. Basically I graduated in a really bad state. 

Now I feel the void that is no longer having my name actively enrolled in a large institution. I miss research and I miss not only learning, but actively thinking and understanding concepts and information not many care to appreciate. 

The way faculty worked and lived at my school was very interesting; it seemed like professors devoted most of their lives to their discipline. They definitely take work home. And I think I like that! But I don’t know if that is right for me. And it makes it all the harder a choice now that I’ve moved back home and am away from campus.",4,2

Well, I don't care about *that* opinion. Im a rising junior in political science, and I've approached many professors and graduate students at my institution, and they all say the same thing:

&gt;You won't get into graduate school. If you do, you won't get into a good one. If you do, you'll drop out before you finish. If you finish, you won't get hired. If you do, you won't make it past post docs. If you do, you won't get a tenure track position. If you do, you'll still be unhappy.

I want to address some of these individually

1)
&gt;You won't get into a (good) graduate school

For starters, that is a terrible reason to not even try. Maybe the chance is very small, maybe I have no chance, but there's no way to know unless I try. The only way I know I can prove you right is to listen to you and give up. 
Moreover, why do you give me such a small chance? We are sitting here at a top-10 institution, I have an above average gpa at a place known for its grade deflation, I currently have a research assistant position, and I've put myself in perfect position to receive a research grant from my institution to pursue my own research next summer. I have worked my ass off to put myself in a position to bring this dream into the realm of possibility. Why give up now?

2)
&gt;You won't finish

What evidence do you have to say that. Yes, something like half of candidates don't finish, but half do. I'm sitting here telling you to shove your pessimism up your ass, so what's to say I can't do that at the next level. Moreover, if I quit now, it's just as much of a failure to me. What is better: to absolutely fail now or to possibly fail in the future?

3)
&gt;You won't get hired/tenure

Maybe. Again, you absolutely may be correct. But, honestly, I don't give a shit. My goal is not to work in academia, it's to get a PhD. Id like to teach at the collegiate level of course, but I could also do something else. To me, the PhD itself has inherent value. Would I be subjecting myself to 5+ years of unparalleled stress for the purpose of a degree that has no practical application outside of academia? Yes, but I'm okay with that.

4)
&gt;You won't be happy

Nah, you're not happy. I'm sorry you went into a field you regret, but I'm my own person


So fuck you, I'm going to do what I want to do.



I'm sorry if this sounds preachy/entitled/anything of that sort, it's just really hard sometimes to push through the pessimism in academia.

I just found out how much they pay. And it’s a great capture of just how little value is given to good (or even comprehensible) writing in research today … 

According to the [Editorial Freelancers Association](https://www.the-efa.org/hiring/member-skills/), the average rate for “heavy copyediting” is $40-$50 per hour (with an average pace of 2 to 5 manuscript pages per hour and an industry-standard manuscript page of 250 words. That comes out to between about 3 and 10 cents per word. AJE’s standard rate is $31 for articles up to 3500 words in length –* one-eighth of one cent per word*. And that’s for a Ph.D.-credentialed editor revising scientific articles written by non-native-English-speaking scholars who will go on to publish their research in scientific journals. (And, to top it off, AJE has a relatively long and cumbersome vetting process for would-be editors. And it doesn’t disclose pay rates until it hires you.)

During my master’s, my major professor became an extremely important mentor in my life and in my work, and we are are in the process of publishing and have already published 3 papers together. Before I left for my doctoral degree, she told me that she would like to serve as an off-campus member on my dissertation committee, as she is both interested and invested in my work. However, she is extremely difficult to work with. Since I have been away from the school at which I did my masters work, I have been thinking more and more how I don’t want to ask her to be on my committee because the process of working alongside her is extremely tedious. On the opposite side, she does know my field and I also feel an obligation to allow her onto my committee because of all the opportunities she provided me during my master’s. What would you do in this situation? 

tl;dr My MS advisor wants to serve on my dissertation committee, but working with her for the past 3 years has made me want to limit working with her as much as possible. She’s an extremely meticulous editor (which is good) but she’s high maintenence.",7,3

I am considering pursuing a second master's in statistics and am wondering whether it would reflect poorly on me if I use my college professors' recommendation letters. I still have those letters saved on Interfolio, and I know they are very strong because I had wonderful, very close relationships with my college professors. My graduate professors worked with me more recently (last year), and would write good letters, but they would probably not be as strong as the ones I already have. Could you all please advise? For example, if an application requires two letters of recommendation, would it be best to use:

* Two very strong, but less recent, letters 
* One strong letter and one good, but less strong, letter from my grad stats professor
* Two letters from my graduate professors 

Thank you in advance for any words of advice!",4,5
