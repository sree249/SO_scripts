6,clwmhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/clwmhp/another_hate_my_job_want_to_switch_careers_post/,"Another ""hate my job want to switch careers"" post","Hey all,

Currently in the financial world and looking to get out. It has become a toxic work environment and I feel like I'm not gaining any new skills. To advance, I'd have to go into sales roles, which do not interest me. I was thinking of signing up at a Technical College near my house in their Software Development program to learn some new skills. The only experience I have was coding websites back in the early 2000's in HTML. My main concern is I have 2 colleagues who felt the same way about our job who quit, went to coding bootcamp, and a year later returned (with a whole bunch of debt) to the same job because they couldn't find anything in the Dev world. What I like about this tech college is they offer 2 externships with local companies along with job placement after graduation (82% success rate). These are two advantages I see over the bootcamps my colleagues did. In addition to that, it costs about 1/4 the price. It does take about 12 months, however, where their bootcamps lasted 6 months. I don't mind the extra time commitment, I feel like that will just give me more time to really learn the material. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my main question/concern is the course list. I'm not sure if the classes will give me relevant knowledge to be able to find a job after I'm done so I'm hoping someone can give an opinion on them. I honestly don't know what kind of jobs to be looking for once is all said and done, but I'm just looking to expand my resume a bit to create some opportunities. The course list is as follows:  **Introduction to Software Development,**  **HTML/CSS Basics,**  **Programming Basics,**  **SQL Fundamentals,**  **Linux Essentials,**  **Version Control Fundamentals,**  **Unit Testing,**  **JavaScript,**  **Java Programming I,**  **Java Programming II,**  **C++ Programming I,**  **C++ Programming II,**  **C# Programming I,**  **C# Programming II,**  **Database Development Fundamentals,**  **Web API Basics,**  **ASP.NET Applications,**  **PHP and MySQL,**  **Mobile Development: Android,**  **Mobile Development: iOS,**  **Software Development Externship,**  **Special Project I,**  **Special Project II,**  **Special Project III,**  **Math for Information Technology,**  **Microsoft Network Fundamentals** 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I should also mention I'm about to turn 34 but still feel like I'm 21. Not sure if that makes a difference but I guess it's a concern when I know there will be tons of CS graduates out there competing for the same jobs who'll have an advantage over me. My bachelor's is in finance and I've basically just done financial services roles since I graduated. Based on that background, is there any type of work out there where I can leverage this experience and combine them with the skills I'll pick up in school? 

Feel like this post is all over the place but can clear up anything with some editing.

Thanks for hearing me out and for any advice you can give.",20,14,2019-08-04 10:02:01

Am I approaching this wrong?","I programmed Forward Dijkstra's Algorithm in C++ with a small sample problem. Process time was 0.0 seconds.

I programmed Bidirectional Dijkstra's Algorithm in C++ with the same sample problem. Process time was 0.0 seconds.

I iterated both 1,000 times, and at first the forward was 7 seconds, and the Bidirectional was 4 seconds. This seemed about right since I thought Bidirectional should be approx doubly faster than forward by design. But when I made it so they printed the same amount of lines, I realized the only difference in time was the print time. (and they both ended up taking 4 seconds over 1,000 iterations.) 

Is this an indicator of a flaw in my code or logic? I don't know how to effectively demonstrate that Bidirectional is doubly faster.... Should I be looking at a bigger sample problem? I need to be able to fit it in a reasonably sized Matrix.

I have  a website where there is a bunch of purchase numbers. I want the users to print this numbers in a click of a button. These numbers are dynamically generated after querying the database. 

I started using [this](https://github.com/tojocky/node-printer/tree/master/examples) npm library to print the purchase number.  When I am developing in my local computer this library is working fine. I made it so that each time the user presses a button in the front end, I make a post request to my Nodejs Server which prints to the printer that I configured locally. 

The problem is that I want to eventually deploy my website to Heroku. Website will be used by a group of people sharing the same network and printer. I do not know of a way to set heroku to communicate with the printer using this package. 

I also thought that printing directly from the front end might be a better idea, but I have to open google on kiosk mode and then do the same for all the users that are going to use this website.

They have a bunch of samples but I'm failing to understand any of them. I think of myself as a fairly competent programmer and yet I cannot even understand the most basic examples, because the samples are not really telling you how stuff works, instead you get instructions how to load some pre-defined dataset, deserialize it into some example class, transforming the dataset a bit and finally calling some generalized method, something like Train() and Predict().

[Here](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/master/machine-learning/tutorials/IrisFlowerClustering/Program.cs) is a good example. I don't know if the attributes on the classes are related to to this task at all. I don't know how I can simply provide the data from memory instead of reading some random format and transforming the data (to what?). I don't know how to start training without a data set. So in the end I get a neat little program that predicts a flower in command line and zero ideas how to use this library for my problem (I'm not sure yet what my problem is yet though). [This](https://lecture-demo.ira.uka.de/neural-network-demo/?preset=Three%20classes%20test) taught me more about machine learning than any of the examples.

I'm planning to do very simple server-side AI which learns from user input. Something basic like XOR gate for start and then move on to predicting string based on input, and so on. So, how the hell I transform `float[] input` to `float[] output`. How do I train the model in real-time? What should I do with strings?

I have fairly advanced programming skills but I'm not that good at (advanced) math. I have tried many times to learn this stuff but it's either too overwhelming and complicated or too much simplified (like this one). So each time I have given up because I don't *have* to learn this.

My company has what seems to be a propietary means of programming PLCs. It's a program that must be licensed individually through the higher corporation with limitations even for me as an employee. Here's the thing. The program used to manipulate the 'code', mostly graphical with a bit of state tables stuff, can only run one instance on a machine and can only have a single file open.  If I want to compare one file to another, I have to take notes or screenshots and switch between files. Much of the code blocks are very ambiguous with god awful documentation and shitty help files. I haven't delved into too many programming areas but I do enjoy Raspberry Pi projects as a hobby and worked on a decently complex real time data analysis setup for a testing lab in college using VBA of all god damn things, not my choice. Now that I'm in what I hoped to be a career, I'm worried the software development side of the business is trying to fix a doomed system.

Is this not an insanely difficult way for employees to work on their own company's programming software? For the method being essentially the same for nearly a decade, is there any hope of improvement? I certainly haven't heard about anything good on the horizon and can't believe many of my coworkers don't share my frustration. To be fair, for most of my coworkers this is their first introduction to programming of any kind. I've already decided I need to jump ship for various other reasons, mostly just wanted to make sure I'm not the crazy one here. I can't believe many other tech companies hamstring their employees like this. I'm starting to feel like a customer, assumed to be a moron, given plastic hammers but told to build a house. I know it's possible to do big things with our stuff as I've seen much more intelligent people than me get it done.

I started programming (in PHP) 17 years ago in my early teens, but I haven't done any significant projects lately, barring custom apps I build for myself to help me in my day job (systems administration).  I have an opportunity to build a website (more a suite of webapps) for a long term client, with a very flexible schedule and a good budget, and I'd really like to take it.  But before I do, I want to get a design down on paper and be comfortable with knowing I can accomplish those things before committing to the job.

The webapps are a type of eCommerce (but highly customized and doesn't fit prebuilt solutions), which sees a decent amount of traffic, currently coded in Classic ASP, they're running into major performance issues, especially with a single webserver/database server setup.  The code doesn't scale and doesn't utilize new hardware well enough to be efficient.  My plan is to propose a scalable solution using AWS Aurora as a MySQL backend, a lightweight JavaScript frontend, and a custom REST API using PHP.  I haven't learned enough about containerized applications just yet to be 100% sure, but in my head, the concept of packaging the front end/API so that I can ship it to multiple regions for scale/availability sounds correct.

So a few of questions:

1. Does this high-level design even make sense with the technology that's out there right now?
2. In a professional opinion, what language would you use for the API instead of PHP? Being in SysAdmin, I understand the security concerns around the language, even though I believe I have a good set of knowledge in it to secure it well enough
3. What modern concepts would you use to make the design more streamlined (development and deployment)? I mentioned containers, but I'm not even sure that fits

I really do appreciate any pointers, I've loved programming from a very young age and I'm really excited to learn some of these new concepts and create something awesome with them.  Once I finish the conceptual design document, I'll be taking targeted training on areas I need help in, so that I'm not going in blind.",1,4,2019-08-17 09:54:16

Back story, I have a son with high functioning autism. I have also worked with other children and adults with special needs and across the board this would be amazingly helpful. We will use my son as an example. Like most children he has no sense of time. This week it was brought to our attention that if he is excused from class to go to the bathroom he can take up to 20 minutes. At home he can take over an hour to eat even something simple due do distractions or getting bored. 

Kids, and adults, need something basic that they cannot change the time on and has visual as well as physical indicators. When I picture it in my head it looks like a basic Fitbit. The teacher, caregiver, or parent are able to control it through a simple app in their phone. For example, my son’s teacher excuses him to go to the bathroom on his own. She sets a ten minute timer for his “watch”. He goes down to the bathroom. After 5 minutes the “watch” gives a little buzz indicating the halfway mark. At ten minutes it starts longer vibration patterns. For the visual indicator I’m thinking a simple LED that slowly fades into a new color as the timer gets closer.

My question is: if I use some tool like matplotlib in python or some similar library in Julia to direct interpolate this data and generate a plot, it simply take ages to do.

I've meddled with Java and C++ in school, but never done any huge projects.

I work at a startup and developed a way of keeping track of our tasks using Google Sheets, and even wrote some script to shoot out emails when tasks were due. However, I knew it was a quick and dirty method of getting the job done, and as the number of projects we're doing increases, the more uneasy I'm getting about the stability and usability of the task tracking method I developed. It isn't anywhere near collapsing, but it's becoming harder and harder to implement new features because I'm pulling data from 30 different sheets into one main sheet, and any format changes I want to make must be done on EVERY sheet, and then I have to go update the email script. To make matters worse, the number of sheets grows with each new project that we take on.

As you can tell, it isn't the most ideal way of dealing with our requirement. From the beginning, I wanted to do a object oriented approach but was forced to settle for this due to time constraints, and the fact that coding really isn't my forte.

I have a little more time on my hands now, and wanted to take this up as a side project. I want to develop a application that's cloud based, available to employees on the go, where they can add/update their tasks, and where these tasks can be stored in some sort of central database.  There are Parts with properties like part name, part number, assembly name, estimated cost, etc. And each part can be assigned tasks with properties like manufacturing process, assignee, vendor name, start date, end date, etc.

Initially, my thoughts were to go with a Java based application with an SQL database because that's something I've done in the past. While that would be within my coding abilities, I felt like it would only work on a local system and would be difficult to put up on the internet where other employees could use it. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I was also suggested to use Grails coupled with Mongo, but then again, I don't know how to make that accessible to everyone over the internet. I'm willing to learn new tools I might need to for this endeavour, but I'm stuck because I don't know which direction to go in. It would be much appreciated if I could get suggestions on how and where to go about this.

Please do not suggest that I use a an already existing task management application! We've tried using a bunch of them, and none of them meet our company's needs. Plus, I really want to take on this opportunity to learn something new and useful. Thanks for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Adding clarification about my exact task management needs since a lot of you are asking about it. (Copied from a comment I made) 

&gt;We've tried Asana and Trello. Also took a  look at a few others like Jira, Kanboard, and Basecamp. While they  implement kanban very well, I can't get get ""objects"". Know what I mean?  
&gt;  
&gt;This  is a mechanical design firm, so in a project, I have several  assemblies. Each assembly has multiple parts, and each part needs to be  assigned tasks that roughly fall into the categories of study, design,  manufacturing, testing; and each of these categories can be split up into several more detailed processes (for example, under design we'll have consultation, 3D modelling, simulation, and 2D drawing). Often, we'll end up with hundred of parts in a  single project, and the tools I came across don't do a very good job of  giving me the in-depth tracking we require. This approach helps us track  things like lead time and create a final bill of materials.

Also, as some people have suggested, the best way to do this may be through a website. After some thought, this looks like the best solution so far. Our website will be up next month, and I'll talk to the designers to see if this can be implemented as a sort of employee login feature. If there are better ways, please do keep the suggestions coming!",27,18,2019-08-18 03:06:15

Isn't Docker easier to use for cross-system operation? Actually, no. Not for me. You see, I suck at Docker. No, I'm not just being self-deprecating. I really suck at it. I can't make it work (except for once.)

Installation instructions usually say something like this: (my paraphrase)   
&gt; You can build this software the hard way, or the easy way. The hard way is to use anything but Docker. The easy way is to use Docker. Just `docker-compose build` then `docker-compose up` and you're good to go! The hard way is bare metal. You have to install 306 dependencies and build 21 C++ modules on a machine running Red Hat Linux (which you don't own and have never used.) Don't even try bare metal unless you're masochistic or have a death wish.

But guess what? I can't make the Docker instructions work. I can, at least *some of the time* (maybe half), make the bare-metal instructions work. Out of the past 15 software packages I've attempted to install using Docker or Docker-Compose, one worked without error (the Kali Linux docker image.) Everything else failed and I was unable to fix with between 30minutes to 3hrs of trouble shooting (and in some cases two days.)

Yes, like I said, I suck at Docker. The problem is clearly not with Docker, but with me, because everyone else seems to make it work without problems, and then promptly sings its praises.",7,3,2019-08-18 09:54:09

I have come across a problem while designing a system. The system will be requesting a set of data of it's users from multiple APIs from different services. Every API has their own limit, such as 1 user per request, 100 users per request per minute or 1,000 users per request per 10 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, my only solution is to have a queue system. Grouping the APIs depending on the limit, for example those in the 10 minutes, 1 minute and no limit. Let's say there are 10,000 users, so there will be 10 requests for each of the APIs with the limit of 1,000 users per request per 10 minutes and 10,000 requests for those that allow 1 user per request.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to see if there's any way to optimize what I am doing now. I can foresee that the data received will get delayed at an exponential rate as the amount of users grow. With 10,000 users, it will take 100 minutes to get a full cycle. But I guess that is to be expected anyway since the API itself has an imposed limit.",3,1,2019-08-18 11:45:15

I've worked with C++ for a good while now, and I intend to start a couple projects that would welcome a clean UI. I have decided that the majority of the code would need to be C++, due to possible performance problems with other languages. This is specific to the nature of the projects, but still prevents me from using certain other tools, for this part of the project at least.

I'm looking to make my applications cross-platform (Win and Linux), but the only experience I have with GUI tools / toolsets is Qt. What other options are there for me to create UI for, for example, a fancy image viewer or a file organizer? **EDIT**: more specifically, are there any toolsets in other languages that would ease development compared to Qt?

My initial ideas were:

* Qt
* Qt Quick
* could WebAssembly work at all here?
* TKinter

I code very iteratively, i.e. make a small change, execute code to see if nothing broke, make a small change, etc.

This means I often have small windows of downtime waiting for my code to finish (usually a minute or two). I find myself often browing reddit while keeping an eye on the execution and return to my work once the execution is done. I feel this method however wreaks havoc on my attention span. 

I would love to spend these small windows on something useful, e.g. learn something new, but I feel these time windows are too small. Moreover, multitasking isn't a thing.

I have tried meditating in these windows, but I feel there's only so much meditation one can do in a day.

I have a function that simulates a user typing a string, printing each character of the buffer at a fixed delay.

But now, I want another behaviour. There has to be a random delay if the user wants, so it will now print each character at a random delay between two numbers.

1. If you add this behaviour to a separate function, it would be almost the same, a copy-paste, except that for now, it takes a tuple (float, float) that specifies the upper bound and lower bound of the random number to be generated.
2. But if you had this functionality on the same function that takes a fixed delay, you would need to add extra parameters, such as random\_delay to be true or false, and then another param to receive the tuple for the boundaries. 
3. You can also make the delay parameter, to take a tuple or float, type check it, and take the path accordingly to the type. The function also has the new parameter random\_delay that takes true or false. But this strategy and 2 leads to the question. **Doesn't a new behaviour lead inherently to belong to a new function?**

I am a student going through a more analytical approach building stuff and will be great to hear your opinion about it, even for such a simple problem.  Would you use option 1, 2 or 3, or even take another approach? Thanks for your insight.",7,1,2019-08-12 08:46:02

Since we have to send them in plaintext, we can't just hash them and store them that way. That being said, storing them in plaintext is clearly not an option.

The process I came up with is as follows:

1. Ask the user for a PIN (can be alphanumeric and as long as they want idc)
2. Salt and hash the PIN
3. Generate a random AES key and encrypt the ""secret"" which is then written to disk
4. XOR the PIN and the AES key
5. Write the result to disk

My line of thinking is that no one can get the AES key back out without knowing the salted hash of the PIN, which would require the knowing of the PIN.

Is there a better way to do this? And/or a more secure way? Thanks in advance

Edit: I should mention that the XOR key is longer than a single character, so it is not just a glorified substitution cipher

Edit2: Some answers to some questions u/moobied had for better visibility: API is third party, and we can either send the user's password to them or an access token. We support both, but no matter what that sensitive information needs to be encrypted. We also do not plan on storing the PIN, nor the salted hash; if the user enters the PIN wrong, we will know when we get a decryption error or a logon error",8,1,2019-08-12 10:05:14

I am not a developer, but I have been able to teach myself the basics so far. 

My best guess is to use AWS's API gateway service. I need directions on the best way to set these up considering all of the current infrastructures I have set up. Any guidance will be much appreciated",0,2,2019-08-12 17:15:16
152,cpjrmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/cpjrmf/trying_to_find_a_simple_algorithm_for_rewriting/,Trying to find a simple algorithm for rewriting into a run-length-encoded binary sequence,"Suppose I have a sequence of black and white pixels, encoded as block-lengths. For example:

3,5,1,2

encodes the following:

BBB WWWWW B WW

Now suppose I want to change the pixels at positions 4 to 7 to Black:

BBB W BBBBB WW

The new encoded sequence is 3,1,5,2.

If instead I had changed positions 3 to 7 to black:

BBBBBBBBB WW

the new encoded sequence would be 9,2.

What I'm trying to find is if there is a simple algorithm for taking one encoded sequence, specifying a block of pixels to change to either black or white, and to then output the new encoded sequence.

Naively, one could decompress the sequence to a string of black and white pixels, make the change, and recompress it, but that's what I'm trying to avoid.

I've figured that I can work out where the new block lies, which blocks it overlaps, and various ways for dealing with all combinations, but it feels like there should be a simpler way.

Does anyone have any ideas? Or any proper names for some of the concepts I'm talking about that would help me to search for more info?

Notes: the first number always represents a black block, so it may be 0. The uncompressed sequence always has the same total length. I'm writing in C++ but I'm just trying to find a simple generic algorithm at the moment.",2,3,2019-08-12 18:31:48

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

    local function switch(statement, input)
    	if statement[input] ~= nil then
    		statement[input]()
    		return true
    	else
    		statement.default()
    	end
    end
    
    local switch_numbers = {
    	[1] = function (x) print(""One"") end,
    	[2] = function (x) print(""Two"") end,
    	[3] = function (x) print(""Three"") end,
    	[4] = function (x) print(""Four"") end,
    	[5] = function (x) print(""Five"") end,
    	[6] = function (x) print(""Six"") end,
    	[7] = function (x) print(""Seven"") end, 
    	[8] = function (x) print (""Eight"") end,
    	[9] = function (x) print(""Nine"") end,
    	[10] = function (x) print(""Ten"") end,

    }
    
    print(""Enter a number..."")
    local x = io.read()
    switch(switch_numbers, tonumber(x))

&amp;#x200B;

So the idea here is that this should save time over a stream of if/elseif statements. Let's say the user inputs something that's not in the table. If this was if/elseif, then the program would have to go through all ten results before knowing that its not on the table and returning the error message.

But (at least I think) with my ""switch"", all the program has to do is check to see whether the input is on the table by seeing if its a nil value on the table. If it isn't, then it'll instantly access the function at the value without having to cycle through each if/elseif. And if it does come up nil, then it instantly goes to the default.

Is that how it works? Or am I missing something?",1,2,2019-08-09 00:23:44

184,cldehq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/cldehq/high_performance_jdbc_connection_pooling_with/,High Performance JDBC Connection Pooling with Oracle Database,"#  TL;DR:

I'm an Oracle performance engineer concerned about connections storms on a very high-concurrency system with low latency requirements. I believe much of the system instability is due to an extremely rapid increase of connections stemming from a large difference in MIN and MAX connections configured in the JDBC (UCP) connection pools. I believe I need material on the danger of large, dynamic connection pools with high-performance databases caused by connection storms resulting from traffic volume changes and brief database latches/serializations. **Oracle makes this clear, but I need persuasive information for developers and middle-tier folks on this topic from well-known, respected, and/or trusted authors or resources in the (Java) development community.**

# Background context if you are interested or like to read:

Hello, I am a lead Oracle Performance Engineer for a very large financial institution, and I need some help from some knowledgeable Java developers. I'm looking for some expertise or assistance on the topic of configuring JDBC connection pools (specifically UCP if it matters) for a very high-concurrency, very low-latency OLTP application running against an Exadata Oracle RAC database ([12.1.0.2](https://12.1.0.2/)).

My understanding/perception is that developers and middle-tier engineers are often taught that connection pools should be dynamic in size (number of connections) to be scalable. This logic makes perfect sense to me. The only problem is that from a database performance perspective (at least for Oracle), large dynamic connection pools are very dangerous. In fact, for decades, Oracle's top performance experts (including their Real World Performance group) have said that most of the performance issues on which they are consulted have issues with the connection pool configuration, and that they spend much of their time explaining why large, dynamic connection pools, perhaps counter-intuitively, make the entire system less stable and more prone to ""connection storms"" and perceived timeouts/delays in query latency.

The reason for this is pretty straightforward from an Oracle DB perspective: establishing a new connection is one of the single most expensive (resource-intensive) operations for the database server and software. The reason is complex, but basically each new connection requires a fairly large amount of CPU, memory allocation, and internal latching to establish the session state required for the new connection (this all presumes Dedicated Server mode, not Shared). A new server process is forked for the session, memory is allocated for the session, much recursive (background) SQL is executed (and often requires parsing), latches are held briefly, etc.

The problem with large, dynamic connection pools when combined with very high-volume/concurrency databases is that, while most establish a relatively conservative INITIAL/MINIMUM number of connections, they often leave the MAXIMUM number of connections very high (or unlimited in some cases). I'm not sure if this is due to industry best practice, training, or the bias of almost every example of how to configure a connection pool in documentation and online, but I digress). Relational databases like Oracle have some operations that are inherently ""serialized"" or blocking. Over the last few releases, many or most changes have been made non-blocking, including as much DDL as possible. The problem is that almost anything else that causes some increased contention (a background job which cleans up orphaned entries in indexes, gathering daily optimizer statistics, creation of a new daily partition on a heavily inserted table, index contention, etc.) There are known workarounds for some of these issues, but not all, and even the workarounds move us away from automation and availability and back to requiring an outage for some maintenance and reverting to more labor-intensive and error-prone manual processes (manual drops of partitions and index rebuilds, pre-creation of partitions, gathering of stats offline or estimating them manually). Most of these things can be easily tolerated by most applications.

However, since traffic is based on human activity (transactions), the workload ebbs and flows (like most OLTP system workloads) and doesn't slow down for DB events! However, once we hit any number of known (or still to be determined) causes of very brief database serialization (required for consistency, durability, maintenance, etc.) will cause a very brief delay to many or all of the currently INSERTing DML records. Maybe stats causes contention, or invalidates the query requiring a hard reparse, or extents/space in a new partition need to be allocated, etc. The problem is, by t+1 second there are many hundreds of active sessions in the database (Oracle's activity-over-time data is captured once per second). By t+2 second there may be hundreds more. Then the database essentially runs like molasses, timing out all queries beyond their 3 second SLA, for between 1 and 8-9 minutes. This is a VERY bad problem for the business (another organization processes the records as ""stand-in"", but we pay dearly). *To the developers and middle-tier folks there is no other alternative but DB tuning. They reason that since the traffic coming into the system doesn't slow, the application server shouldn't throttle it in any way. The question is when does not throttling cause a part of the system (the database) to become the performance bottleneck?*

I believe the primary reason the system as a whole is so volatile and sensitive is that the connection pool treats the database as if more simultaneous work will deliver faster overall results, which is backwards. In fact, it's rather amazing the DB can recover from the added stress of the new connections being ramped up at high velocity (using CPU, latches, parse locks, and memory allocation), especially when all the sessions begin to wait on the same thing.

**My question is, how do I convince skeptical Java developers and middle-tier folks that this is worth investigating?** I have much literature from Oracle and various Oracle performance experts to document and even demonstrate the problem, and actually recommend a static pool configuration (MIN=MAX), as long as the min is set high enough. Basically the DB gets massively overloaded and as a result performance spirals downhill until the DB &amp; host somehow get through the wall of connections thrown at the database. I am well-respected in the organization, but I'm having peculiar trouble convincing this team to consider how they configure their connection pools. They have many small pools with a MIN of \~5 and a max of over 100 on each of the hundreds of app servers on JVMs. I realize having a static pool may be impossible when you use your app servers to spread the load like this, but there is even a product from Oracle called ""Database Resident Connection Pool."" It was originally designed for connections that didn't have access to their own pool (like Java), but recent versions include JDBC/UCP enabled pools. **I believe I need to find recognized experts or resources in the developer or middle-tier circles that give this advice (at least for Oracle databases) or explain the dangers of overloading the database with connection storms.**",3,1,2019-08-02 22:20:12

In one of the algorithms, they say the answer can only be X, Y, or Z. I've gotten several cases to pass with my own code and was really stumped because I had no idea why so many were failing. I decided to work backward and put X, Y, and Z as my return statements and sure enough hardly any of them pass. When reviewing the answers there are no failures do to time restrictions either, so it leads me to believe that some of the cases are just unsolvable.

Now, im a complete rookie at programming, i only know the absolute basics but i have a pretty clear idea of what i want. I don't know for sure if its possible but i would like to create a program that would allow me to convert a JSON data file into a video.

&amp;nbsp;

The JSON file is a chatlog from Twitch.com with userid's, timestamps and everything necessary, [see image for clarification.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kcFZN.jpg) 

&amp;nbsp;

The only thing missing are the custom emotes and badges which i assume could be fixed by identifying the keywords and replacing it with the corresponding emote? My goal is to somehow convert this in to a video of the chat, with a transparent background allowing me to overlay it on top of the gameplay.

&amp;nbsp;

If we want to use a new one, we have to write a justification for it, have it go to a board of lawyers, and go through a bunch of other steps before our administrators are allowed to download and install any of it.  And it's not due to price, since it seems especially difficult for open source tools.  Sometimes it takes longer than a year and by then the tool is already old.

So I'm authoring a memo that argues to our management that this is terrible practice.  That we would be much more efficient if we were allowed to use our own judgment and use tools that we think would help us do our job better (especially when they are free/open source).  I could understand if a developer is asking for a $1M dollar suite or something, but not when it's free.

I read an article in the past about Google's development process, and I understand that they are extremely lenient on what tools developers are allowed to us.  I wish I could find that article, but I cannot anymore.  Is anybody aware of an article that would help me make my case?

1. Company
2. Department
3. Project
4. Employee

* And we need to track which employees are in which department, what projects does a company have - etc.
* And also we need to read and write these to a file.

Would you use UUID variables in each object and have references to it in all the others? I tried that but ran in some weird C++ compiling problems (like what headers I need and how to #include properly) and got stuck.

I'm thinking I could use strings and keep the classes separate? E.g. a company (object) ""ABC"" has an employee ""John Smith"" (string) and an employee (object) ""John Smith"" has a company (string) ""ABC"", and when a query for employees comes in I loop through *all* the employees but only print the matching ones. (It doesn't need to be scalable).
