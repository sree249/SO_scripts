Her publications, grants, student reviews and service are looking good.

However, the school culture isn't a good fit and she would like to snag a position elsewhere. So she is getting her materials together and doesn't know what to do about current references. Obviously, she doesn't want anyone to get wind of her looking for work elsewhere, as she might need to stay put at this job.

She does have letters of support for the upcoming contract renewal from faculty that observed her teaching, which would be perfect for the application, but those can't be used, correct?

She has old reference letters but the application wants current...thanks for advice on this and the situation overall--it seems precarious but I hear it is common. I don't know how to help her to advance with grace and care.

edit: after reading the first two responses--and thanks so much--she's thinking the smartest approach is to be granted renewal and then resign before looking for another position? She doesn't have anyone who would write a substantive letter that wouldn't be totally shocked that she's interested in leaving. Plus, she would have to ask for the letter right before renewal deliberations--how would they recommend renewal knowing she wants to leave? what a conundrum!",9,12

7,7,ak8r65,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/ak8r65/academic_fraud_discovery_advice_needed/,Academic fraud discovery - advice needed,"tl;dr Academic fraud from 2010 was used to acquire millions in charitable donations from the parents of sick children, in addition to grant funds, which were then spent on pointless experiments and/or used to build up the careers of the fraudsters. I have no faith in reporting this to the university as they have swept previous complaints under the rug. Looking for advice on the best way to bring this to light to ensure the fraudsters are removed from their positions while hopefully keeping the lab itself intact as they have ample equipment (paid for by the charity) and skills to succeed if they can get competent leadership. (In Australia)

&amp;#x200B;

Identifiable details are little vague for obvious reasons.

I was a PhD student in a small lab (4 people when I started, 12 when I finished) dedicated to finding a cure for a childhood disease, it was located within a hospital. I chose the lab specifically as it was funded by a very successful charity group and I thought this meant it would be focused more on results, and less focused on papers/grants. From the beginning there were ethical, transparency, and expertise issues. The lab head and his right-hand-man were not very knowledgeable about the topics they were meant to be experts in - they were able to use all the right words with enough confidence to convince a lay person, but within the lab were useless to get any advice from. Their time was mostly spent rubbing shoulders with the 'right-people' in other institutions and getting their names out there at international conferences where they presented lab members work. This did not prevent them from claiming credit for all work produced.

Me, being a PhD student, who had research experience in a different discipline (Computer Science) dismissed these concerns as 'they must know more than me' and 'this must be how it is in medical research', so I just carried on. Over time it became more and more obvious the lab management were misleading the charity as to how relevant of the work they were funding was to the charity's main cause - curing a particular childhood disease. These funds were provided with no scientific oversight beyond what the lab management provided. This concerned me greatly as part of our job was meeting the donors, often the desperate parents of very ill children. It spurred me to push the lab management for details on 'how' the experiments they were conducting were actually of any use to the development of a cure for the disease. I was met with hand-waving and non-answers so I kept pushing - i.e. 'I know *x* &amp; *y* but they are irrelevant because of *z*, so how does the experiment *actually* contribute any progress to a cure?'. This was met with significant hostility and it was made clear that I had to accept their non-answers or not be a part of the lab.

I was worried about making a complaint as the charity that funded the lab had spent a lot of volunteer time building up the reputation and contacts needed to pull in the almost one million dollars a year to fund the lab, and I didn't want to damage them or their hard work. I arranged to speak to the head of the charity covertly, and laid out my main concerns - namely that the lab had potential, but was being thwarted at every turn by the management. The charity head confided in me that they had harboured their own concerns about the lab management for a long time but had hoped the lab head would retire allowing a new head to come in and remove the 2IC. He also said he has spoken to some other members of the lab who had also raised concerns.

A few months later the charity announced they would no longer be funding the lab (after more than 8 years), and would instead be funnelling their charitable donations through an existing competitive grants system. The public reason for this was that 'they had been so successful in raising funds they needed to diversify'.

Now that the charity was free from the lab I spoke with other team members and compiled a long list of complaints including: misuse of funds, bullying, misleading the animal ethics department, lack of supervision, etc and spoke to the University's ethics department about it. They assured me it was a valid complaint that I was able to back up with documentation, so I went ahead with it. A few months later I get a response from the University that the complaint had been found unwarranted, and they addressed each complaint individually dismissing the direct misuse of grant funds as 'repeated financial oversights' and dismissing the lack of supervision without even talking to anyone in the lab. I feel they very much swept it all under the rug.

Shortly before the the university's ruling another member of the lab - a very skilled post-doc who was a recent addition to the team - discovered that the 2010 results of the two seminal publications for the lab were faked. Misplaced start and stop codons in dna sequences meant the positive results they claimed were impossible. To be completely sure the post-doc secretly sequenced the original dna sequences used in the papers (which were still in the freezer), and repeated parts of the experiments using a corrected sequence as a positive control. We can only assume that the lab heads were not getting the results they wanted, and lacking the skills to properly diagnose the problem they faked the results. This caused millions of dollars of research funding, and millions of dollars donated from the desperate parents of sick children to go into the hands of two incompetent scientists who proceeded to flush it down the proverbial toilet for 9 years until a post-doc discovered the reason there had been no results over this time.

The post-doc in question took the discovery to the lab head around August last year - who apparently 'turned white' - but has since pretended the conversation never took place and seemingly has no intention on retracting the papers.

I have no faith in taking the evidence of the academic fraud to the university due to their sweeping-under-the-rug of my previous complaint, but am unsure of what to do now. I would appreciate any advice. The post-doc who discovered the fraud is still employed in the lab and as it is her only source of income she is concerned about coming forward before she secures a new job. I feel compelled to prevent more money being conned out of desperate people, and more grant funds not being awarded to real scientists, but am uneasy about going public without being able to ensure the careers of the innocent post-docs and students in the lab.

This is all in Australia.

After graduating I spent 3 years in a job unrelated to physics.  I would like to get back to a physics career but I have a couple of big obstacles.

First of all my degree sucks(2:2). I was always good at physics/math, winning lots of national competitions during school but at uni I fucked around too much. I set a goal of getting a masters degree and did minimal effort to get there, I spent last 3 years regretting that.

Second, I was an international student in UK. I was lucky enough to have my family found my studies but that is not an option anymore. I come from a low income European country and do not have much faith in the education in my country. I would ideally continue somewhere in the EU but founding could be a problem.

I am not sure what my options are now. Going straight for PhD seems unreasonable as both my degree is bad and my knowledge has decreased a lot since graduation.

Since then we've travel the world together, fell in love numerous times with each other, got married and most importantly somehow barely managed to make our marriage survive her getting a Ph.D. All this time I accepted the fact that everything else in my life would come second to hers until she got her PhD. There was the constant moving, not allowing myself to get too close to people to make deep friendships because I knew that there was a chance at the end of the academic year I might never see these people again. I haven't been able to lock down a career or an education path of my own. Because there's always the chance we'll be moving somewhere, I'm forced to work menial jobs sometimes two full-time jobs at a time. 2 years ago I was working a nine-to-five job Monday through Thursday Friday and then on Friday night I just wouldn't sleep and work my second job until 9 or 10 in the morning on Saturday, get a few hours rest and work all night long Saturday to Sunday for a total of 70 plus hours a week. I did this for almost 3 years. I've basically put my own life on hold for the past 12 years because I truly adore her. I also figured that when she got her Ph.D everything would become a little less stressful and we could have a semi-normal life again and maybe I or things that were important in my life wouldn't have to come second as much. And maybe even the family we've always talked about. Unfortunately this just doesn't seem to be the case. There's more stress, even less time for us, and I feel like I just don't matter at all. A few weeks ago I came to the realization that I had suppressed so many parts of my personality and who I am, my own needs or who I want to be, that I just got in the car and drove to the nearest hospital because I just couldn't handle it. I was so depressed that I was terrified I might do something stupid if someone else didn't intervene. I've tried talking to her about everything, I've even had some friends try and intervene and talk to her. I know she understands the concept of what I'm going through or what I have gone through these past years but I don't think she honestly is capable of having that compassion, whether it's due to her stress or something else going on with her. We've talked about marriage counseling and I think that will help however since she's on the complete opposite side of the map from me right now the next time we'll see each other is well over a month or so away. I know spouses and partners of academics need to be cactuses but even cactuses need water every once in awhile.",15,45

A few weeks back, I received a call asking if I wanted to come in for an interview (the candidate that beat me out was moving on). Position has been open since summer, they haven’t had time to fill it. They did not post the position. Went to an informal interview. Submitted references the next day (yesterday).

Communication has been spotty through the whole process. Partly, I believe, due to losing their admin person (budget cuts). It sounds like the department has been overwhelmed by having to cover the admin duties (they just received the ok to reinstate the position).

Today, I receive an email from someone who was unable to attend the informal interview saying, “I’m so-and-so, welcome! Can you come help with this group activity in a few weeks?”

I'm a bit worried about how my relationship with my supervisor is turning out, was wondering if you think this is normal. Also just want to moan a little bit. 

Background: Worked with this supervisor on my master's thesis. We worked pretty well together, I genuinely enjoyed his approach, the amount of feedback, and all the guidance he provided. As a result, my master's thesis turned out really well and we are getting it published. 

Obviously wanted to continue working with him, so we bounced some ideas off each other and came up with a research question, for which I wrote a proposal and he then edited. I didn't mind the edits because at that point they were mostly just directing me to develop certain ideas, but I still wrote it myself. 

Applied for several scholarships, he started insisting that I send him all the applications for editing. I don't mind, but he's sending them back HEAVILY edited. He basically rewrites all of them himself, leaving only my ""ands"" and ""buts"" in, everything else is crossed out and replaced. I got the funding, and would have otherwise been thrilled about this, but I just don't feel like it is me who got it, more like he got it for me.  

Now he's just emailed me putting me in touch with another student of his. He basically met that other student and told him all about my project and wants that student to get involved. Of course I had to agree that he puts us in touch, because he's already talked to that student, but I just wish he'd suggested this to me first so that I at least had an illusion of agency. 

To clarify, the PhD doesn't start until September, I'm doing other academic work at another institution at the moment, but he wants me to start working on this now (I agree, why waste time)

&amp;#x200B;

What bothers me is all the heavy editing and him putting me in touch with the other student. I don't feel like I have any autonomy anymore, and feel like I'm a child in one of those bicycles with a parent handle, being taken for a ride by my supervisor who goes ""See? You're doing it yourself, well done!"". I guess this is just my own insecurities, but this whole situation seriously bothers me. I do want his guidance, but at this point I feel totally incompetent, as though I won't succeed unless he improves my work or just does it for me. 

Is this normal? Is the first year of PhD basically blindly following your supervisor? Do you get to be more and more independent as you progress?

TLDR I feel like I'm just doing whatever my supervisor tells me to, or he just does things for me. No autonomy whatsoever. Is this really okay? ",7,7

I have a very strong interest in Narratives and have been reading a lot of Narratology, trying to come up with a research proposal that works with narratives. Talking to a few people I get sense that it's not well-received. But this seems to be from their experiences taking undergrad classes in the subject that focused on Classical Narratology - from which the entire field has moved on. The contemporary debates are far removed from the days of Genette. The professors I've spoken to are more interested in a basic understanding of Narrative theory that's suited to their immediate scholarly/research needs and left me only more confused as to the ""state"" of narratology.

So what I'm asking is, as a scholar who wishes to work in the field of Narratology and possibly dedicate a great deal of my life to it, what should I know about the field before I enter it? How are Narratologists seen in Lit/English departments?

A-WEAR is a four year (2019-2022) H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network (ITN)/European Joint Doctorate (EJD) 4 bringing together five beneficiaries and 12 partner organizations from **Finland, Czech republic, Italy, Romania, and Spain**, with the aim of educating, supervising, and training **15 young ambitious** **and** **creative researchers** to face the future challenges in smart wearables and wireless computing and enhance their career prospects by training them in a multi-sector cross-country environment and teaching them to think globally.

The emerging market of wearables is expected to grow exponentially in the near future, driven by the sales increase of smart clothes, watches, and eyeglasses. The future wearables are likely to be heterogeneous, operating on batteries, sun power or human motion, and endowed with smart functions. They will co-operate in a decentralized manner with each other and will be able to reach various interconnected software and applications. The main stream wearable-based architecture has been applied so far in wellbeing industries, such as eHealth or ambient assisted living, which might also reduce the costs for care and guarantee a healthy independent live in the forthcoming older society. As the digitalisation and data-based economy are growing, the exploitation potential of the wearables can easily be expected to increase. Key wearables stakeholder groups in the future are also smart cities, comprising intelligent building industry and infrastructure, energy-efficient smart grid sector, public e-Services, and smart transport. Motivated by the opportunities that next-generation wearable intelligence is expected to provide, the mission of A-WEAR action is to cross-disciplinarily create new architectures, open-source software and frameworks for dynamic wearable ecosystems, with distributed localization and privacy constraints. We aim at building new joint/double European doctoral programmes to train a new generation of young researchers in order to be aware of, to cope with, and to disseminate to a large audience the vulnerabilities and the corresponding solutions of the communication and positioning through wearables. The impact of A-WEAR will be to enhance the future social well-being, to contribute to an easy living, effective and enjoyable work, and to offer new solutions to the challenges of violation of privacy by communication and positioning through wearables and to the need of applying the right of the ownership to one’s data.

Hey there fellow academics.

I have allowed myself to be in the position of building and delivering the lectures for an upper level undergraduate course as a sessional lecturer. Trouble is, although perhaps I am technically qualified, I really feel pretty much at sea in terms of what the hell it is I'm supposed to be teaching. The topic is broadly in my field, but I have no direct experience or knowledge of this particular sub-discipline, just a smattering of factoids leftover from coursework past. I also have never taught a course in its entirety and thus do not have that kind of experience to fall back on.

I feel as though I have rather unwisely put myself in this position, and that I'd be much better off to conceal myselfin some underground cavern until May.

I'm a full time employee but am considering doing a MS part time. The deadline for the fall semester is in 2 months, so I'd ideally like to ask my recommender to write and submit a letter now, but I have a couple of concerns:

1. I may end up moving away from this job for a couple of reasons. If I get admitted but then end up moving (because of personal reasons or for a better job offer), would it create a lot of awkwardness between me and my recommender, or would they understand it as life happening? I'd obviously like to be respectful and keep a good relationship, and of course I may still want to apply to other grad schools in the future (say a few years down the line)
2. Does it matter in any way if I may also want to use this rec letter for PhD recommendations later on? Should I just communicate this to the professor? My areas of interest are applied math / stats / CS, and the professor is a math professor, so I'm assuming that they can write one letter of recommendation that should work for all three of those subject areas (and for both MS and PhD programs).

Two things are currently giving me problems with confidence though:

Firstly, impostor syndrome. Not only with regard to the linguistics, but also because I've never been to India and am not in a position to do so either. This makes me feel I'd be being some kind of armchair director, disconnected from my subject matter and out of touch.

Secondly, I'm white and British, so very aware of my privilege, and India is a very complicated place with a complicated history. How can I possibly do justice to that when I've never even set foot in the country? I don't want to do a disservice to them academically or in any way, but what if my linguistic opinions are opposed to a native Indian's linguistic opinions? Why would I know better? What if my eurocentric views subconsciously hinder me?

All of this makes me wonder if this area is too personal or too sensitive to work on, but there must be other Western scholars who do not succumb to orientalism. It seems a shame to not focus on what I love for fear of causing offence or being wrong because of subconsciously inherited cultural biases. I just want to be respectful and have academic integrity.

I have no research experience, and not sure where to start in terms of obtaining i️t but I plan on asking counselors and former professors for help on that matter. 

Currently have a 3.8 GPA. My only concern is that graduate programs in this field typically require a ton of math. Other than taking AP Statistics and AP Calc BC (which covers until taylor series) in high school, I haven’t taken purely math courses in undergraduate.

Here are some relevant courses I have taken/am taking though: Microeconomics for Business, Macroeconomics for Business, Applied Business Statistics, Business Finance, Investments. I also plan on taking Corporate Financial Strategy next semester.

My concern is I don’t really have many elective class spots left for my senior year to take all the required math courses (Calc II, Calc III, Linear Algebra, other stats courses) + take courses I want to take in the finance/econ field (i.e intermediate economic theory, stats for economists, econometrics).

What line of coursework would you say is very crucial to get into a top Finance/econ program. Should I take math courses next year or more finance/econ? Very confused, need some guidance. I would much rather take classes in Finance/Econ but then I’d have graduated with far too weak of a mathematical base. Would programs consider me if i were to take those math classes at a CC after i graduated?

**TL;DR: how do you use referencing software? Do you manually edit citations in-text? Help!**

Hi all

I’ve reached my wits’ end with referencing software and wondered if you fine folks could help. 

How do you all use referencing software on a daily basis? 

I’m about 1/3-1/2 the way through my PhD thesis (Forensic Psychology) and have been using mendeley for this time. I save references and citations, (but don’t keep a folder structure) and then use the MS Word plugin to cite in the document.   
 

For Psychology this is typically ‘name (date)’: Smith (2005), said biscuits are good. The citation manager presents the citations as ‘(name, date)’ however. 

To get to name-date formatting I therefore manually edit the field in the word doc to meet my needs. This somewhat breaks the link to library (citations won’t update) but retains the ability to create a bibliography etc.  
 

Is there another way to do name-date in-text citations I’m missing? 

Is this a reasonably effective way to use referencing software? 

I feel like I am not using the software ‘correctly’ – it all feels a bit ‘workaround’. 

I’m trying to move over to Zotero from Mendeley, (due to the latter starting to lock down and encrypt all data locally) but in doing so I’ll lose all the manual edits to citations I made in Mendeley, (they will be overwritten to ‘(name, date)’ so it looks like I’m going to have to trawl through 70+pages of literature review and manually update all references. Arg.

I'm currently a Master's student at an Australian Uni and have some questions about the (formal and informal) necessary skills and requirements to get into Oxbridge.

For a variety of reasons, I didn't do particularly well in my undergrad degree, but believe I am doing very well in my current degree. It's a Master's by Research, so it' consists only of a 40- 50,000 word thesis, no coursework or classes. My supervisor is quite famous in their field, and happens to be an ex- Oxford student. They still have some connections to Oxbridge/ highly renown  academic in the field, though I'm not sure how relevant this is. Crucially, I feel, my supervisor believes in my abilities (they once told me I'd have ""no issues getting into Oxford, for example""), speaks to me as an equal rather than a subordinate, and likes me personally, which I believe could have an effect on my career path. 

The problem is that I so far have gotten ZERO scholarships, and haven't yet published anything. I plan on publishing 3 pieces (chapters that can later be published as independent articles), but the scholarship issue is stressing me out quite a lot. One of my close friends has been awarded two fairly prestigious scholarships, has helped me out with one application (I used her winning application as a very rough template, and truly believe I easily lived up to the standards of her application), from which I was knocked back. I know of multiple other students in my cohort who have been awarded scholarships and cannot for the life of me figure out how or why. I'm obviously biased, but I know that some of these individuals arent particularly clever or great writers, yet they're succeeding in ways I'm not (for what it's worth, I've read the work of many of the individuals I'm commenting on). Also, the people who have read my work seem just as baffled by my inability to get any scholarships so far. I hate to toot my own horn, but I'm a clever and lateral thinker (especially in comparison to the vast majority of fellow students), a good researcher/ writer, and have a strong work ethic. And then there's the snowball effect- the more scholarships you have under your belt, the more highly respected you'll be regarded and more seriously considered for further awards. Or that's at least my impression. I'm trying not to get too disheartened and am still going to continue to apply for scholarships, obviously, but this sucks. I was wondering if anyone had experienced anything similar/ if anyone had any good advice for improving scholarship applications? And yes, I know each scholarship is different etc, but I'm in desperate need of any words of wisdom.

And back to my original question- has anyone here gotten into Oxbridge? How seriously do they take into account scholarship awards? Do positive references from academics personally known by staff members of the institution/ your potential supervisor make any difference? What else do they consider when weighing up your application?

I’m taking a Lit course this semester. I am formerly a Lit Major ( now a History Major) and so am familiar with the format and expectations in writing up literary analysis. So far we have had 3 writing assignments and I’m having trouble understanding the adjunct instructor’s rationale for grading. I’ve been told that my writing is “over erudite” , “ too complicated” , and that the “language is too complex “. 

The grades I’m receiving on these assignments reflects the instructor’s comments. I have not had this kind of feedback from any professor so far in my experience at University. Obviously I am perplexed by this because 
a) I have several tenured professors that routinely have praised my writing. 
b) I am a non-traditional older student ( mid 40’s) and the voice/tone I use in writing essays, term papers , reviews, etc tends to be representative ( I think) of my age, maturity level, and (compared to traditional college aged students) a more sophisticated/informed world view. 

The written comments in the margins of the assignments indicate to me that the instructor seems to expect a full understanding of the content immediately. They seem unwilling to simply read the content, and let it unfold. Having no patience to read through the material and digest some of the nuance of what is being articulated before scribbling out notes like “I don’t understand what you’re getting at”, only to later jot out a quick “Ahh, I see now” when the writing has achieved its intended goal. 

Anyway, here’s where it gets interesting; 
I got an assignment back today but did not realize that the instructor also gave me the graded paper of another student mixed in with my paper. I didn’t catch the snafu until well after class. 
So I read this student’s paper ( I couldn’t resist) and then see that they received an A, and my paper apparently only warranted a B- ... needless to say I’m more than agitated. Closer to livid actually. 
The writing for the instructor’s version of an A paper is lacking in basic form, simplistic, and uninsightful by my humble estimation. 

I have already had a previous conversation with the instructor about expectations, and as a result I’ve actually tried a sort of “dumbing down “ of my writing. But it’s insulting and unjust. 

What is a tactful, level headed way to address this? What would be an effective strategy in trying to talk to the instructor about this? Or would that be fruitless? The entire situation is infuriating. ",12,0

Hi internet hive mind,

Hoping you can help. I've had a super negative long term work experience, with 8+ people having had similar experiences with the same terrible manager and his wife (who we all know fucked her way to the top). 

I'm in academia, so there's arguably fewer protections here, but I have collaborated with many of the other people that were unhappy and I'm spear heading an official letter of complaint to submit to a higher level of university HR. 

Do you have any tips or tricks or resources that you can share? I'm looking for specific phrases that are more effective than others (exhibit a: I just said someone fucked their way to the top, I don't think I should phrase it like that). 

I don't want to get anyone fired, genuinely. This just has to stop, or at least get some sort of closer look. Some of the issues we faced frequently were: 

\- chronically under-managed with no communication

\- followed up by micromanaging flurries of rage and hyperactive scrutiny

\- unclear communications about projects that we were (I am in a happier job, just FYI) given at the last minute and that fell solidly outside our job description, even the ""other duties as assigned""

\- aggressive behaviors and bullying tactics when we raised concerns about schedule constraints, unreasonable deadlines, lack of direction

\- unexplained absences for at least half of the work day, in direct contravention of a ""working overseas"" agreement I KNOW they had to sign. 

I appreciate any help I can get! I understand with academia you can get some ""strong personalities"" (IMO a weak excuse used by even weaker people to never critically examine their own management styles) but the way this played out for everyone on the team for the past four years just got ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Any advice on how to phrase official complaint letter (signed by many people) to raise concerns about a manager in academia creating a hostile work environment?

warning-this is going to be mainly a vent.
 I'm so bummed out right now and it's been like this for a few days.

I have always been kinda shy type student, it wasn't like this  always but ever since high school. And now in college, it's been proving to be quite problematic for me.
I have troubles talking, discussing my doubt in class with professors. And not just in class, but even outside the classrooms, I don't always approach them thinking they'll think I'm so stupid compared to my peers that I didn't even get this thing right.

My professors are all very nice and encourage students to always ask when they have doubt but I, being a dumbass never ever talk to them. One or two times, I did actually talked to them, it was after re-revising the thing in my head many times before I uttered a word.

 And recently, I needed recommendations to apply for an REU at a place I was interested in, but ended up not applying because I thought no professor really 'knows' me so what's the point of asking a letter from them?

Sometimes I think that it may be because I'm the kind of student who doesn't 'get' everything taught in class immediately, I actually have to go look my notes/book, try to understand the material better in my own before I'm able to come up with things I might have a doubt over.
And this doesn't mean I'm lazy or anything, I try my best in everything, just my study style doesn't match up with the majority.

And I guess my profs expect me to come up with questions like others, who quickly grasp everything, and it's making me disappointed with myself that I'm unable to do that. 

And the coursework this semester, is so huge that reading the topic ahead of every class just so I kinda already know the material is also impossible.
On top of it, just because there are one or two people in one of my class, who are doing their independent studies in the same area as that course and so kinda have the motivations to do things in the course already and hence are able to ask things in class is making me more irritated with myself.

And I am very annoyed at myself for not being the same as my peers who are normal, not shy or inconfident or anything and I wish I could just take a pill or something and be like them as my profs expect me to.

Thanks for reading, in case you have.

I don't really expect any replies to this post but if anyone's gone through the same shit and would like to share something, it would be great.

 P.S.: Sorry if this is in a wrong sub, I didn't know where else to post it and don't know how to move it to another.

EDIT 14/02/2019- Thank you everyone for your advices and kind words. This whole thread has been very uplifting and has motivated me to change the way I was going about attending lectures. I have started making an effort to talk to professors step by step and hope to continue this way the whole semester. Also, I will read the comments here from time to time until these new habits get instilled in me.
So, once again, thanks everyone! ",14,11

The metrics are the Short Dark Triad (I'm missing three questions from the psychopathy subsection), the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, and the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale. Our goal is to use these metrics, which are highly correlated with sexually coercive behavior, to identify some potentially coercive individuals to do some follow-up tests. Missing part of the psychopathy section might not be that big of a deal, but no one else I know does anything like this, so I don't know who to ask.  


In case you're curious, we missed these three questions when we put them in the survey because, in the paper in which they were published, they had ended up on the top of the next column, which we didn't see because we read it on a computer instead of on a paper, so it was hard to ""see"" the full set of questions.

I have received two competitive scholarships from top tech companies (one had a research component), and also have won various hackathons. I'll be participating in my first datathon this year. I have a strong GPA + recommendation letters.

However, people are telling me that my non-traditional background, lack of research experience (I'm in my Junior year and will be working on my first project this summer), combined with the fact that I go to a small university that's not well-known pretty much destroy my chances of getting into a top PhD program without a Master's. 

Is that true? I prefer not getting a Master's because of my age, and also because I cannot afford it. Should I give up my dreams of getting a PhD at a top university and doing research to work for a big tech company instead?

&amp;#x200B;

I was a graduate assistant to the senior vice provost of my university when I was finishing an M.S. in applied statistics. My contribution was statistical analysis for a survey that was distributed by the SVP and his colleagues across a few universities. They then wrote and published a book based on the results of their research - the portion that my SVP wrote included a lot of the results and figures of my analysis.

I was mentioned in the foreword/acknowledgement section of the book for my contribution - is this something I can/should put on a CV/Resume?

I currently list the assistantship on my resume as a position I held and mention in the description that portions of my analysis are in the book, but not sure if that's the most effective/appropriate way to display this (or if it's appropriate at all).

I've recently joined a new university, and my project supervisor put me in contact with another department member for help in an aspect of my work. At first they were very helpful, having a meeting with me and giving me some suggestions for my work. However, they had planned to assist me in an aspect of my work and I gladly agreed. When I sent an email asking when they would like to begin the work, I received no reply for 3 days. The work is time sensitive and I had seen them around the building today at about 17.00, and so I decided to go to their office and just ask them in person what their plans were. When I knocked on their door, they looked visibly irritated by my being there and rudely told me to come in, and then said they hadn't replied to me because they were unsure of their schedule for the following few days and were waiting to hear if they needed to attend a meeting on one of the days I had suggested we meet. I was quite shocked at how visibly bothered they were that I had come to see them and I very quickly apologised, and (after they said the work was nothing difficult, though to me it is very different and new) assured them I did not need their assistance on the day (and hopefully I won't, I do have faith in my own abilities and if not then it is a learning curve). 

Am I wrong for thinking that a more professional approach would have been to just fire off a quick email letting me know their schedule was unclear, and that i should go ahead with my plans and they'd try and check in on me from time to time (which is what they ended up suggesting anyway)? I understand academics are very busy people, but not replying to emails at all for days when you've offered personal help seems unfair to me. 

In our very first meeting they bad-mouthed a student of theirs who was waiting outside their office without an appointment, and I am now afraid that they will say similar things about me to other students or staff. Am I over-thinking this? Please let me know.",5,9

A few years ago, I connected with ""Joelle"", largely because we had similar research interests and because she got a (TT) faculty position I applied for but didn't get. Three years later, I have grown to dislike working with Joelle. Among other things:

\-She desperately wanted to write a grant with my undergrad mentor, who's a big name researcher in this specific area, but my mentor was like ""She has no substantial research background in this area--this is too risky. I'll collaborate with you, however!"" Joelle ended up bugging my mentor so much that my mentor blocked her on Facebook.

\-She lies about her publication record. She consistently claims to have something like 30 peer-reviewed publications and 10 first-authors, but searching on google scholar brings up a record that more like 10 and 3.

\-She doesn't seem to understand the basics of publishing. She read a rejection letter for a manuscript and insisted repeatedly it was a revise-resubmit decision until I asked to see it, where it was clearly a rejection. She also doesn't understand things like ""You have to reply to reviewer comments in a revise and resubmit decision.""

\-Her writing is poor. Like, ""why would you put those words in that order?"" poor.

\-She's consistently pressured me to put pressure on people I know in the field to do things like accept her manuscripts or write grants with her.

\-She consistently pressures me to move up her authorship order on manuscripts.

\-She calls me at random times (7pm on a Friday, 10 am on a Saturday, etc) unannounced and expects me to pick up. Would I do that for a close collaborator, someone where we're in a serious time crunch. or a close friend? Yeah. But it seems invasive coming from her.

22,22,amiaua,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/amiaua/most_papers_are_a_terrible_presentation_of/,Most papers are a terrible presentation of scientific results - Change my mind,"This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine and I am interested if this is something that other people agree with. But first a bit of background: I am a postdoc in bioinformatics. As a bioinformatician I have no strong ties to any particular research community and I read papers from medical, biological, statistical, biochemical, mathematical and computer scientific backgrounds. Each field and each subfield comes with their own landmark papers, jargon and notations. To me, reading papers is more difficult, because I am often not aware of many things that the authors take for granted. But in all fairness, I know that a lot of researchers are very deep inside their research subfield and people tend to know what certain notations and expressions mean. And that is fine with me.

With this situation in mind, I still want to make the case for ""most papers are a terrible representation of scientific results"" because I feel that most papers impose an unnecessary burden on the readers.

Let us first consider the purposes of a paper (according to my own understanding):

&amp;#x200B;

1. Describe and present scientific results
2. Explain the motivation for the work
3. Explain how the results fit into the bigger picture

&amp;#x200B;

Let's talk about these in detail:

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Describe and present scientific results:** There is usually a main result that makes it into the title of the paper. The first figure (if there is one) often supports the main result. So far so good. But after that I feel that the Results sections tend to be just an agglomeration of additional pieces of results. A lot of details with numbers intermingled with text. For the reader it is very difficult to see what else could be of interest. It feels like people are trying to squeeze as many results as possible into the paper (or its suplement).

In a similar fashion, many Material &amp; Methods sections are very unpleasant to read. A lot of these sections contain the description of procedures in prose form. I suppose that journals dislike lists in papers, but lists are actually the perfect stylistic element to represent procedures. Short list are also great for parameters for machines/software. Speaking of software: I find it very upsetting when the source code that produced the results is not available. As a programmer I prefer to read code instead of human-readable text. Simply because code is unambigious and contains all necessary details.

The Discussion is usually the most readable part. It is where one can get a better idea about what the paper is actually about (if the abstract was not clear enough). The authors often emphasize the improvements over the state of the art in the beginning of this section. After that the reader might get lucky if the authors go on a tangent that is of interest to the reader. To me, this has been rarely the case. But I am probably not the primary audience in most cases.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Explain the motivation for the work:** This part is about the ""why"" of the project. The motivation for the project is usually burried somewhere in the text and easy to overread. This might not seem like a big issue, but the decisions that the authors made while doing the project probably depended on that motivation and it is easier to understand a paper when the motivation is known. I think the motivation should be displayed more prominently on papers.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Explain how the results fit into the bigger picture:** I guess most papers are fine in this regard. I suspect that people are afraid of not putting enough references into their papers ;)

Is there a way for me to ask that she doesn't submit final versions of things we are working together on without me being able to look at it first?

So, I think I'm in a strange situation right now. I had to leave my PhD a few months ago due to some reasons at this very fancy uni in my country (has a good international reputation).

It was mostly because, the faculty I was working with was a kind of bully and working with him for a long time would work affected my mental health significantly. 
I have a paper published in a journal from that time I worked with him.

I kept no contact with that prof after I left that place to keep myself same and while I was leaving, I did not argue or fight with him or anyone just because it's not professional and also because I'm not an idiot and our paths may cross sometime in the future. So, you can say that I went on my seperate way quite peacefully with no drama. 

Now, after months I'm reapplying for a PhD mainly to Europe and some North American universities. And I am being advised to take his recommendation letter and being told that I should talk to him because he will be contacted since I have a paper with him so it's better that I talk to him myself. And some even said that I'm sabotaging my career by not talking to him and should just put up with it. And that the worst he can do is say no.

But given the dynamics of my relationship with him I don't really want to email him again and ask for a favor.

In the end I hope to settle on a field by graduate school. So from graduate school point of view, what would be the better choice? Science school or directly Biomedical engineering?
Also, I from what I know neither of these would get me a proper job with just a bachelor's, (financials are important for me but idt a business degree or most others engineering degrees (being quite narrowly focused) would satisfy me) but if that's not the case could you guys give details regarding that as well?

(BTW this isn't from US. I'm an international student applying for undergraduate right now, and the current offers are from CHKU Biomedical engineering, CHKU Scinece school and HKU Science school.)",22,10

I deeply enjoy learning, and try to take as many courses at my institutions as I possibly can at once, often having to write appeals so I can take on extra courses. With this I also do my best to put together a plan to complete on my personal time, and I model it as if it were from an institution. I really enjoy this practice, and working through my designed studies but I tend to have trouble getting a quality structure for a particular course. 

Normally what I do is decide on what I want to learn next, right now it is a Intro to Logic. Upon deciding on a topic, I then detail if I will need prerequisites or if i can dive right in. In the current example with the Logic course, I have taken multiple philosophy courses in the past so I dove right in. With a more complicated topic I would create a course plan that would build up. Once I have decided on the topic, and whether or not I need to take preemptive course, I begin looking for materials. 

This is where I am looking for assistance. There is no shortage of textbooks, but it is very difficult finding a quality book. In a normal college setting, the professor has a required text that they feel best fits within the lesson of that they are teaching. With that suggested book, there will also be some resources or course plan. These will often be listed on the syllabus, stating week-by-week what will be gone over and any major resources used. 

I have no issue using the templates on college websites to line up which courses to be taken in which order, but as for the content of those courses I want to ensure it is quality. Often I ask my friends that are in school to save their syllabus', course materials, and course outlines so that I can take them and use them for my personal studies. That way I know that the materials are in some way credible, reliable, and proven to a degree. I have amassed a decent amount of materials, books, and courses from a variety of colleges, universities, and schools but my collection is not all too extensive. 

I am trying to create a full course plan for myself that could be sufficiently compared to what one would get when enrolling in a college or university. I plan to set up a schedule of courses to be completed in semester increments and that will slowly build over time. 

If this is not the proper place to post this, I apologize and I will post it wherever it is appropriate. But any advice, suggestions, or input would be greatly appreciated. I would be more than happy to further clarify if needed. ",0,2

Namely that I am writing a thesis that has some chapters that bring together a lot of material that I have not seen published together in this context. Those chapters are not publish worthy, but I would like to be able to easily reference them in future work and for people to actually be able to find that reference. I personally have had a hell of a time looking for other folk's thesis when the only place they are stored is at their university. It seems that each university has their own systems of storing these and none of them are great. Also (as that answer also mentions) I would like to be able to offer an errata to any readers without having them hunt it down.

&amp;#x200B;

I have reservations of course. At my current career stage I am basically a no body so I don't love the idea of someone scrolling through arxiv updates and seeing ""astrogate1's Awesome Thesis!!!"" and have them think I am arrogant for thinking my thesis deserves special attention.

I recently left a position for the private sector, and although I have experienced occasional pangs of regret, they're fading, especially as I quantify the differences [LONG].","The recent spate of ""quit lit"" usually is written by people who were adjuncts or lecturers or post-docs for years, and finally realized they were never going to make it into the ""dream"" tenure track job. Recently (because of my own experience) I've been looking for examples of folks who were in actual tenure-track jobs and left, and found far fewer examples.

Maybe I'm unusual, I don't know. But I would *urge* those in graduate programs-- and even those in academic positions-- to consider whether you really want to be there. You *do* have options. Don't stay in a job that makes you miserable because you think it's a problem with you. It may just be a problem with the fit, or with the job as a whole. Not everyone is cut out for academia, even those who make it in!

Before my PhD I worked (with a master's) in the private sector as an archaeologist. I decided I wanted to go back for a PhD because I wanted to reach that milestone. I knew the academic job market was tight, but I don't regret it in the slightest. I made it. Got the tenure track job and all. 

And I found that I *hated* it.

---

When I finished my PhD I went on the academic job market. Numerous applications, no offers. I began working in the commercial side of things in my field, but because of conditions there-- I made the stupid mistake of signing a non-compete that was probably unenforceable, but could still have cost me a ton in legal fees-- I decided to have another go at academia. After a second round of applications, I was offered a tenure track job. Hooray!

Pay was better than many of my friends who had also gotten t-t jobs. The teaching load was heavy (4/4) but (I thought) manageable. And the research requirements were relatively low.

I worked constantly. Weekends, mornings, evenings. I put hours into my lectures. The students loved me, I got great reviews and evaluations. I wrote (and won) grants, and I published. Not nearly as much as I wanted to, though. 

On my first annual review, my department chair told me that I needed to spend *more* time on my teaching. I was a little taken aback. I didn't argue with him, but my initial response in my head was, ""How?""

I realized that his view was that if I was doing research (and I talked about that a lot because I was excited about it) that was time that could be better devoted to teaching. Uh oh.

One faculty meeting, the folks from our Research and Grants Office came to talk to us. I had already worked with them several times since I'd been there, writing and submitting. I happened to sit down with them and chat before their presentation, and I realized belatedly that my department colleagues were on the other side of the room. At that moment, I became aware that in the year that I'd been there, I'd probably worked with those folks more than my department colleagues had in the entire time they'd been there. Uh oh, again.

After my second year, I thought I'd be able to put my teaching on *a little* autopilot and focus more on getting some of my research into pubs. I had been literally in the office at 6am every morning, and there most weekends, working on lectures for new preps for the last two years, and figured I could now devote a little more time to writing. I don't like being trapped somewhere, and I saw my diminishing pub record (especially compared to my friends at other universities) as a liability if I ever wanted to go somewhere else.

So I was pretty pissed when my teaching load was changed and classes that I'd taught for two years were going to have to be entirely reconfigured to a new schedule. So much for more time for research and writing. Uh oh #3.

I'd had it. I spent every moment of my time on the job, got ""you need to spend more time on teaching,"" my class schedule rejiggered because ""enrollment was down,"" and my CV was getting dusty.

I submitted my resignation in early August and started looking for jobs outside academia. It took my a few months, but fortunately I had a substantial savings built up. And then in late November / early December I was offered a job.

I've since done some calculations.

My field is anthropology / archaeology. So we're not 6-figure salary folks except at the highest levels.

My t-t contract was 9 months, $65k / year when I left academia. I'd received one raise of a little less than $1000 from when I started, and I'd been told that raises had been unheard of for years. Ouch.

During my 9 months when I was being paid, I worked mornings, evenings, weekends, holidays... I had a few days off here and there, but I was always working on some level. And then during the 3 months I wasn't technically being paid, I was working on research, writing, class prep. 

My new job pays slightly more ($67,500 / year) for 12 months. That doesn't sound like a huge difference, but consider...

I can treat this job as essentially a 9-5. My work consists of a combination of field archaeology and writing, not to mention working in different places, managing people, working outdoors occasionally. It's billed to clients. We don't work off the clock. We can't. That's how we get paid. I don't work weekends, or nights, or mornings, unless I want to, or on the occasions that I'm actually in the field running a crew. And then I'm paid, and compensated. And my time off is my own, even if it's (on paper) far less than what I got as an academic. I get holidays where I don't have to work. Weekends are mine again.

If you break down the amount of time that I will work, even over 12 months, compared to how much I was working on a 9-month contract, the difference is *substantial*.

Even better, I don't have to cease my academic research and publication, but I can do them on my own time. It's no longer a requirement of my job. I enjoy it, and I plan to continue it. I have work with colleagues I'm engaged in, data from my dissertation that I've yet to publish.

I reviewed a paper two days before I started my new job. I took a break from working on a paper to write this. My contribution to the discipline is not over, and in fact, I may be able to actually do *more* now that I can treat it as *fun* rather than a job.

And raises are a regular occurrence. As is merit-based advancement.

---

I realize that some of this is specific to the type of university (small, public university) that I was at. Not everyone will have the same experience. Not everyone has. Clearly many people *love* the academic life.

But it's not for everyone. The warnings about work-life balance are something I always laughed off, but it's real.

I watched my colleagues teach teach teach and publish almost nothing. I saw them do virtually no research, and yet still earn tenure. I heard them telling me to try to recruit majors... at a small public university where the students are mostly from the region, and may not ever leave, an anthropology major is not going to be something that people can support themselves on.

I couldn't participate in the racket any longer. I wasn't willing to work myself to the bone constantly, and to have no time when I could put work aside and just enjoy something else without thinking ""I should be working on a lecture / paper.""

I get that many people love academia and wouldn't want to be anywhere else. I think that's great.

But consider *very* carefully if you could be happier in another part of your field before going too far down that road. Even tenure-track positions are not all they're cracked up to be.",31,72

Her project sounds very interesting to me, I honestly can't think of a topic I'd rather work on. However, the faculty demands a contribution of 5000 pounds from external students. I believe there are several reasons for this:   
\- She told me her department is very full and I can imagine that there needs to be a barrier from research groups taking on internship students, which are basically a free pair of hands from their perspective. 

\- Tuition at Oxford is 9200 pounds a year, so this fee (for approximately half a year of research) more or less equates to tuition costs. 

\- Oxford is a highly prestigious university and they can practically charge whatever they want.

&amp;#x200B;

I've just gotten my notes from my examiners for my MA thesis in the humanities and am overall happy with their feedback. They were complimentary but were sure to point out some issues in terms of argument, primarily in one chapter. I wasn't put off by their notes but considered their engagement with my thesis  a good sign. I mean, their criticisms (to me) did not seem overly harsh. In fact, they mentioned that the thesis was thought-provoking and engaging before bringing up some shortcomings.

&amp;#x200B;

But today I met with my supervisor who ultimately said that ""I may not pass"" unless I write an ""amazing and nuanced"" opening remark. This person asked me to send them what I'm writing for my opening remarks (10 pages) and basically just made me feel like my thesis isn't good enough to pass. 

&amp;#x200B;

This person also knows that I have a job lined up as a writer following the defense and even made a comment that I need to ""be a good writer,"" if not only for the defense but for my future job... even asking ""how *did* you get this job?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose I am just hoping for some clarity. Is the MA defense really this grueling? I had always understood the defense as a sort of conversation about the project. Of course, I will prepare for the defense... but it seems to me that for some reason my supervisor just doesn't believe in my project or my academic abilities... even going so far to question what's next in my career...

This advisor was someone I was stuck with early on in my PhD career, and has been nothing but discouraging. He has said probably 3-5 times that “the PhD isn’t for everyone” and “You should really just consider leaving and finding another profession” despite the fact that my grades are good, I passed all my comps with high passes, and have excellent teaching evaluations and am respected by my peers. I’ve won multiple grants for my research as well. 

From speaking to my peers this is something he has done to them as well. (Though, without getting into conspiracy theories, he seems to disproportionately do this to female PhD candidates.) The point is, he seems like a miserable and unsupportive person. 

I recently received a VERY large grant that is one of the most recognizable (name-wise) and competitive grants in the country. I’m really excited and I sent a short, professional email to my advisor to inform him. I also informed the associate head of the program, who didn’t realize I’d already emailed him, and cc’d him on my congratulations. 

He is not acknowledging it in any way. Like, I’ve seen him in person, he’s sent emails unrelated to this, etc. The program I’m in is small and I don’t know of anyone besides me in YEARS who has won a grant like this. People in our college system (junior colleges) have won, but no one from our program. I don’t usually like to brag but this is definitely a big deal. 

Should I continue to ignore it, or say something like “Not sure if you’d heard of...” or send a follow up email? The thing is, he is the administrative and academic head of my program, so his support and willingness to promote this would be really helpful. I can go down other venues if needed but I also admit there’s a part of me that’s hurt that after years of working together (despite it not being the most pleasant experience on my end) he can’t acknowledge this huge honor.

I am submitting my first article to a journal soon that summarizes my masters thesis work. I sent it to my adviser earlier this week for his first review, and he sent it back with comments and added 4 other guys names to the article, 2 of whom I never spoke to once during my whole thesis work and the other 2 who provided tiny bits of guidance here and there. He never told me he was planning to do this until just this week. Frankly, I am surprised that he would suggest they all be added as authors when I did essentially all of the work. There is one guy on there that I can kind of understand, as he was helpful in teaching me how to code my data analyses. I have no problems with these four guys in any way, but I feel like this is fraudulent and am not comfortable with it. After getting to know my adviser, I don’t trust him to begin with so I don’t know if I am being too skeptical, but I know people who have contributed so much more to research projects and never had their name on those articles. I know it is common to see a lot of authors names on one paper, but is it right when one person does 99% of the work and some literally did nothing? Is this yet another case of men taking credit for a woman’s work, or is it acceptable to give people credit for work they had no part in?

Also, instead of fighting him on it (with his hot temper it will lead me no where) I suggested we add our female colleagues name because she provided more assistance than the other guys whose name he added. Normally I would not suggest adding her name for the level of work she did, but if he set the standard of how much work is required to have a name on this article, I’m going to fight for her right to be included. I think he overlooked her because she is another woman.

In my field (Political Science) there are several well-respected female scholars that have at least 1 publication under their maiden name. Still, most seem to have married in grad school, because their name has been the same for most (if not all) of their career). I know others say it's best to always publish under the same name. I have even read stories about male faculty members who perceive female colleagues who change their names as less committed, but I've never heard these kinds of comments from people I know personally.

I know at least four professors who seem very willing to write me fairly strong letters of recommendation(in Philosophy, Psychology, and Media Studies), and who were very impressed by my performance in their classes. I have presented two papers at the local undergraduate conference. I am hoping to get a third one published with one of the aforementioned profs over the summer, if I can. I have also done 4 independent studies and an applied study, which should count as research experience (at least one of them was on a fairly underresearched topic, hence the possible paper), and have been a paid research assistant to two different profs, in two different fields (Spanish Film and Digital Humanities). I don't have a very strong math background in terms of advanced courses, but I am taking metalogic right now and I have tutored statistics, through the school's tutoring program, for three consecutive years. I have also learnt to use MATLAB and R over the course of my undergrad. I haven't taken the GREs yet. 

I have already given up on a PhD, at least right now (I love academia, but I'm already a bit burnt out *now* in senior undergrad, so I would probably end up having a mental breakdown and moving to Tibet for a while. Plus there is the whole 3% success rate). Still, I would like to do a research-focused MA, hopefully doing something with game theory.

I don't really care whether my MA is in Philosophy, Psychology, or Economics. I have even looked into Legal Studies and Library and Information Science as options. I think all of those have about the same likelihood of working out for me, it being entirely dependent on finding the right advisor with the right research interests, since whichever program I find would have to be fairly interdisciplinary regardless. 

For now, my plan is to spend much of the summer contacting possible advisors, apply to places after graduating, and spend some of the interim working to pay off debt. I am internationally-focused, and so basically don't care about where in the planet a program is, so long as it is in a temperate zone and costs are minimal. So, mostly Europe, I guess, but hey if Argentina has an awesome program, I would love to go. I am academically competent in English and Spanish, passable in French, and I would be willing to learn another language for the purposes of doing the MA.

I recently came across a PhD position that addresses a topic that I'm very interested in. However, I have some doubts about it because:

1.) The program approaches it from a more cultural/social way (it is interdisciplinary but tied to the cultural theory dept) when I would like to so something more technical. I'm not sure to what extent I can steer the research to be the way I want given that the home university doesn't have such a high expertise in that area. 

2.) I'm not sure that this is the best path to take career wise. The PhD stipend is okayyyy but I could definitely make more money doing other jobs. I've worked in academic research for about 3 years before and I like it, but I'm not sure if it's something I want to do forever.

3.) One reason why I'm attracted to this position is that it will allow me to stay with my boyfriend in his country. It's a really silly reason but if I really value this relationship and want to keep it going. But if we break up then I'm not sure if I would want to continue with the PhD. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my question is whether I should apply to this PhD anywa?y  And will be repercussions if I were to start it but then drop out before completing it? I imagine it would look really bad on my CV. The second question applies to all funded PhD positions in general. ",4,3

Thankfully, I absolutely love my research and my advisor (for the most part lol) and that’s honestly the only thing keeping me going.

My problem stems from the following:

- I had to file 4 Title IX complaints against people in my department. The guys will *not* take no for answer. Some pursued me for over a year and became sexually aggressive or harassed me via text, even when I clearly did not respond to any communication or clearly said no to attempts to hang out. I would be approached in class, my office (showing up unannounced), or “dropping by” my apartment. I stopped showing up to class and required seminars to avoid it. I was not aware their actions were in violation of Title IX until someone pointed it out to me. 1 one of these people was a friend, another was a close friend, and another was borderline best friend. It seems to be a case of unrequited love, but that doesn’t excuse them to treat me like shit or ignore lack of consent. This happened over the course of the last 15 months and was just one person after the other.

- note, I’ve been asked out/pursued my entire life, even when I clearly had a SO and I’ve never had 6 people mistreat me because I said no. I grew up in CA, went to undergrad in NY, and am now in KS. Is this just coincidence or some weird midwestern behavior? Everyone I’m discussing is from the area or a nearby state.

- there were 2 additional Title IX-ish behaviors of people, one of them graduated, so I didn’t bother. The other has been chastising me for not texting him back after he gave me his phone number unprompted. I’ve been out of the country for 2 weeks and I’m dreading him stopping by my office and asking why I didn’t text him.

- I had to cut out these people, or they eventually cut me out. This excluded me from pretty much every friend group in the department. I never hang out with anyone or get invited to things anymore, which sucks realizing that they only cared because they wanted something physical out of me. All of my other friends live on either coast and I’m an only child with parents old enough to be advisor’s parents lol. I’m effectively friendless day-to-day.

- my only friend in the department is one of those people where you say “can’t live with them, can’t live without them.” If we didn’t work together, I probably wouldn’t put so much effort in. She is toxic and downright mean. She does things like tell me that I’m an overachiever and make everyone in the department look bad because I’m ambitious and driven, even by doing things like joining swim club. I never brag or gloat about grants and fellowships I receive, but she even told me that she automatically hated me when I was accepted because the department announced that I was on a prestigious fellowship. She views the successes of others as her own failures and constantly projects this.

- for solutions, I have done the following: joined marching band for a year to try a new friend group. I’m nearly a decade older and I couldn’t deal with the teen drama as most of them went to HS together.

- joined swim club for the last 2 seasons. It’s ok, not drama but the group is dwindling to 5-10 people and it’s more of an activity rather than friendship thing.

- work out outside of swimming, it helps with mental health and such.

- spoke with CAPS and the ombudsman. CAPS doesn’t really do much for me, they said given the circumstances, I seemed to be positive and doing all I can. I didn’t like the ombuds approach - they told me everyone else had unmet needs and I need to cater to them. I discussed this with my advisor and he agreed we couldn’t do anything about the negativity of my only friend.

- I despise the weather in KS. It has been a harsher winter the past 2 years than it normally is. I’m also very into outdoors stuff and hiking - KS doesn’t cut it for me and I leave every academic break to go somewhere else. It helps, but I dread getting back on the plane and landing here.

- I’ve picked up hobbies like reading (again). 

- I had a rapid onset of allergies to cats and dogs, so I can’t volunteer in the animal shelter anymore. I have a pet lizard and he’s great, but I can’t really get anymore with my travel.

I don’t want to live my life borderline hating everyday, but that’s the point I’m at. I’m even considering driving home and *living with my parents* for part of the summer (I left for college 10 years ago and haven’t been home for more than 3 weeks at a time). I figure if I’m at least near hiking and a better outdoor situation, that could help. Any ideas or suggestions? I don’t want to look back negatively on this part of my life/career that will be a huge defining moment and I want to make the best of it. ",13,8

The moment I stood up my mind when completely blank and I babbled like an idiot for 15 minutes. My mouth went dry, it felt like I was going to die, and I felt like running off the stage. Afterward people I didn't even know came up to console me because it was so obvious I had a panic attack.

Months later I was asked to present another project, and this time the director of the NIH would be present. I should have been honored and excited to present something I'd put months of hard work into, but instead I just felt terrified. ""Just be well prepared and practice more,"" people told me. ""You need to just go back on your SSRI,"" my parents said. I did both and went into the presentation with a positive attitude. The same thing happened and I worried that if I didn't explore other avenues to deal with this problem, it would effect my career for the rest of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to my psychiatrist and we discussed some options. We decided a beta blocker was a bad idea- my resting bp is very low and I'm the type who passes out in a hot shower, so a vasodilator is probably a bad plan. We decided on a low dose benzo. A few days before my presentation I took one to see how I felt, and I didn't feel loopy or sedated at all.

Well yesterday I took one before I presented my research and felt like a totally different person! I still felt some anxiety (these aren't magic pills), but I was able to control it and not let it affect my performance. One of the judges even commented that I seemed very calm and collected.

&amp;#x200B;

Benzodiazepines have a terrible reputation in the world of medicine. I know some psychiatrists (my father included) who won't even prescribe them to their patients with panic disorders for fear they'll become addicted. Should you be taking them every day? Absolutely not- for most people these should be reserved for special situations.

But the bottom line is: if you've exhausted all of the other options and it is severely affecting your life, you should consider talking to your doctor about it. As someone intimately familiar with the healthcare system, I can't emphasize enough how important it is to advocate for yourself and what's best for you career and self confidence.

I am hoping to borrow your wisdom on the following two issues my own google research could not find out a satisfactory answer. 

Q1. Is there any online webpage where you can click your specific beliefs (e.g., pro or anti governement spending) to find out where you fall in terms of macroeconomics schools of thought?

Q2. Where would those who self-proclaims as bipartisan or moderate right or left fall in terms of schools of thought?

Background: I am one of those who majored in economics but never learned to the point of how modern/frontier economics are dvided (post-2010). My guess is that probably classical divisions of schools of thought are no longer holding true in academia, but I wonder what schools of thought are there that does a better job of subcategorizing or reflecting different beliefs. Even Mankiw, who seems to be relatively unpopular among the younger generation students, seem to hold diverse views depending on agendas. 

For instance, many people whom I have met held mixed views (e.g., prefer small government but support government regulation on certain issues; sometimes even supporting universal basic income).

How do you know where you fall in terms of the ideological spectrum? Such detailed breakdown and better understanding of schools of thought will be especially helpful in the next upcoming elections, which probably will be full of simplified slogans. Maybe categorization cannot be done, but a terminology similar to ""right-wing Keynesian"" would be still very helpful.",0,1

Really need some advice.,"Hello all! I’m a 2nd year clinical psychology PhD student and I have had quite a rocky start toward completing my degree. This will take a lot of explaining but I would appreciate it if you bear with me.

I graduated with my BA in psychology in May of 2017 and immediately enrolled in a clinical PhD program the following fall (2017). I chose this program for financial reasons as well as the fact that my mentor was/is a perfect personality match. Things were great first semester, as I completed 4 classes with straight As and was in good standing with my assistantship and research responsibilities.

Then second semester hit. My assistantship supervisor had to have surgery which put her out of commission for 2 months. During this time, the program director took over as my assistantship supervisor and my job expectations changed, as I was instructed to create multiple materials (e.g., surveys, workbooks) for an upcoming seminar where ~60 people were expected to attend. Now, my new supervisor is a notorious micromanager and has a reputation of projecting her anxiety on a multitude of students. I was no exception. I was constantly criticized for my “lack of professionalism,” as I wouldn’t provide her with updates on pretty much a daily basis. In hindsight, I definitely was not as organized as I am now, and I recognize that. That being said, the micromanaging only served to exacerbate the situation and was counterproductive. This was also my first semester of practicum, which is the other source of my troubles. My practicum supervisor was friendly and we had great rapport. However, come time for mid semester evaluation, I was blindsided by many of her ratings. The combination of criticism from the program director (my substitute GA supervisor) and my practicum supervisor resulted in the establishment of a remediation plan, which lasted a full year. And I completed it, and was restored to good standing in the program this past January. I thought I was out of the woods. I was wrong. 

Two months later, it came time to interview for a therapy practicum placement after I had been excelling at my current assessment practicum site. This is a position I had interviewed for last year (before I was made aware of my remediation) and I was actually offered the position, but had to decline. I went into this interview already familiar with who I was speaking with. I thought it went really well (again). Apparently, it did not. I was “effusive” according to my interviewer. Granted, I am a very expressive and talkative person. I guess I came across as unprofessional as a result of this. I was also not selected for a new GA position that I had interviewed for because of the same reason. I received feedback that my extroverted interaction style was seen as both a strength and a weakness. While my interviewer specified that she does not have concerns that I would ever SAY anything unprofessional, my interaction style might just come across that way to someone who was not as much of a fit with my personality as let’s say, my mentor. 

So now, as a result of these interviews, the program director recommended me for termination/matriculation into the masters program. I am devastated.

Keep in mind that I successfully completed my remediation plan. I have been excelling in classes as well as practicum. I have been productive in my research, and I have performing well regarding my assistantship duties (Funny, when my old assistantship supervisor came back from surgery after remediation was in progress, my ratings were suddenly satisfactory again!). Despite my massive improvement in all of these domains, the program director claims that my level of professionalism has regressed, and she is basing this solely on these interviews (GA interview and practicum interview). It is also worth noting that these interviews occurred within a week of each other, so I had not received feedback before the second one. 

I am not denying that I am talkative. I am not denying that I can be a little casual in the work setting from time to time. I am not denying that I have made mistakes, and part of my growth has been acknowledging my shortcomings instead of being defensive like I had been in the past. I had also enrolled at the age of 21, so I was not nearly as mature as I am now at 23. Yes I’m still young, but these experiences have had a drastic impact on my defensiveness and responsibility. 

I am just upset because I had made such an improvement in my overall level of performance, and all of that is for nothing given two interviews that did not work out during a time where my good standing had already been reestablished. There has also undoubtedly been a conflict of interest given the program director’s role as both the initiator of my remediation and my substitute assistantship supervisor. I am appealing the termination, and I honestly am not sure of my chances. My current supervisors (practicum and assistantship) expressed their willingness to speak on my behalf, so I am hoping this carries weight and speaks to my overall level of professionalism.

To be honest, leaving this program wouldn’t be the end of the world, as I had my reservations about coming here in the first place. The program has also been harshly criticized recently by several students of color for cultural insensitivity and a majority of student agree that there has been a general lack of support from faculty. A lot of red flags from the start of my time here.

So, my question is: Where do I go from here (given my appeal does not work and I am forced to leave after finishing my masters)? I know for a fact that this is my destined career path, and I want to apply to other PhD programs as coming here was clearly a mistake. I would have no issue getting letters of recommendation from my current supervisors, my GRE scores are still valid, both my undergraduate and graduate GPAs are stellar, and the program director said that there would be no explicit record of “termination” on my transcript. I’m just scared about my chances of getting into another program and how I will explain myself in potential interviews/personal statements. Oh, it is also worth noting that I have 5 publications and over 10 conference presentations, so my CV is definitely my strongest application asset. 

Any advice or opinions on my situation would be appreciated! 


TL;DR - Entered a clinical PhD program at the ripe age of 21 right after graduating. Got put on remediation. Completed remediation and have been excelling since.

There'd be the odd workaholic, but most of my peers were happy to have the occasional coffee catch up and Friday evening drinks were common. I'm quite a social person so I really enjoyed this and it definitely made work more enjoyable. 

Since completing my PhD, I've joined a small research centre in Social Sciences. We're a team of about 13, including two postgrad students. The team are not very social and many do not socialise, not even to take a lunch break or short coffee break. It's a very different atmosphere to work in, and for someone who gets their energy from socialising with others, I find it somewhat depressing. The energy within the office is often flat and sometimes even a bit negative/unhappy.

I've tried to encourage socialising and small breaks, but it hasn't been hugely successful. One of my colleagues even makes snide remarks implying that those of us who do take breaks (mostly the students and newer team members such as myself) do not work as much or as hard.

I studied Economics and Conservation Biology at a US University (I am American).  Over the past few years I have been combining the two with both paid work and volunteering in China.  

This past week a professor I have been doing some work with invited me to study an masters in Conservation Biology at his university.  It's the best for the subject in western China and the professor I would be doing it with it is renowned in government and NGO circles across the country.  I also have personal reasons and other projects that I can work on here, and it certainly doesn't hurt in-country opportunities being one of the only foreigners doing a unique form of study in China (e.g. not related to language or international relations, etc.). 

However, I know that the reputation of Chinese degrees overseas is average at best and a joke at worst.  I would certainly be more focused on what I get out of the time doing the degree rather than the degree itself.  After the program, I am thinking of applying to a western university for a PhD - likely in something along the lines of Environmental Economics.  

My question is, would having done a masters in China be looked down upon and hurt my chances of admission to a western PhD program, or would it be looked at as a unique and specialized experience that can really help in my research?

We would have a small talk when I made him coffee. Eventually, I quit working there and started working as a barista in another cafe, not on campus. Once he saw me in one of the study rooms in the department where I was studying and he came in. This was the first time we met outside that cafe on campus. He said: "" Since you stopped working at that cafe, I started making coffee by myself"". At that time I didn't think what he said was weird and took it as a compliment. I thought he was very friendly.

&amp;#x200B;

We started his module. Once I got a very low score on a test and got very worried I went to him to ask how the questions should be done. He explained to me and after that, I asked him for a book with solutions. He later sent me an email with it. In the email, he said that I did the hard question correctly and that coffee can help me for better concentration. I agreed with that and after that he said. ""I should not only teach you physics, but also coffee drinking"" to which I didn't respond because I found it inappropriate. He emailed me 2 days later again speaking about coffee. I thought I am misinterpreting things and replied.

&amp;#x200B;

That professor and I would meet sometimes in the department and have a few words. He came maybe 2 more times in that study room, but only when I was alone, not when my friends were there. Things got weird again once in one of his workshops on a Friday. He came to me and said “ You are dressed like you are going to a party. Are you going out tonight?” I felt extremely uncomfortable. I said “Haha, yeah” and continue to do my work waiting for him to go somewhere else, which he did. I heard the 2 students behind be saying that was very inappropriate. I was very mad that day at him, but I thought again that I am misinterpreting things. The Monday after he came to me in that study room when my friends left and offered to make me a coffee his way (which he has told me before how he does it). I said “ok” and gave him my cup. He asked me to come to the teachers’ kitchen where students are usually not allowed and said that it’s ok since there is nobody there. We were having a small talk and eventually, he said: “ You look very different from Friday. With that dress, with that charming dress.” I got too uncomfortable after hearing this, but I was trying to remain calm and I said that I regret wearing this dress at uni. And then he asked me again: “ Did you go out that night?” I felt even more uncomfortable after this. I said a few more words so that I don’t leave things awkward and left.

However, I have a video interview for a tenure-track position with an osteopathic medical school that is being built and will be affiliated with the university I have a job offer for next Monday. 

While I understand I haven’t even done a first-round interview yet with the DO school, I am extremely hopeful for a position. I received my interview invite within 3 days of submitting my application packet. And there are other things, so my next question may be jumping the gun quite a bit.

Is it completely unethical and wrong of me to accept the instructor position (I have asked for an extension of acceptance since it would involve relocating and selling our home plus we need further time to discuss other things) and then IF (big IF, I’m trying not to go on assumptions or hopefulness but that’s hard to do) I was offered a tenure track position at the DO school, to rescind my acceptance?

My senior male colleagues are aware and supportive, and introduce me as Dr. so and so (I have a Ph.D.) and a colleague in the department.

One thing I'd like to add to the course is a short video (3-5 minutes) every week that highlights a chemist (or scientist) working in various fields talking about their background and what they do.  For example, one week is a chemist working in cosmetics, next week is forensics, then agriculture, then pharmaceuticals, etc.  I'd especially like to feature stories of scientists from underrepresented groups (women, Hispanics, Blacks, etc.) so students see that science, and chemistry in particular, is open to anyone.

The only website I've found along these lines is [Behind the Scenes at MIT](http://chemvideos.mit.edu/all-videos/).  Can you recommend another?  (If not, I think I might just launch my own and begin interviewing various scientist friends.)

Also, I've already had a lot of graduate level courses in my last BSc. year and obviously during the MSc., so the first 1-2 years of courses would be kind of redundant (I see that these are on the level of QFT, Quantum Stat Phys, General Relativity, Quantum Information, etc. -- have seen all of those already). I'm at a point where I really want to work on a project, instead of doing courses and problem sheets all the time.

To those of you who have submitted poems to academic journals before, I was wondering 2 things: 1) some of the journals I have checked out (Feminist Review, for instance) ask for ""abstracts"" even when you submit to their open space section (i.e. section for more artistic pieces like poems). 

What should I put in this section when submitting a poem?

-4 Exams 100 points each
-Homework is total 100 points and for each with less than 85% completion, -12 to overall homework.

Here's my exam grades(before curves):
-Exam One:49
-Exam Two:62
-Exam Three:40
-Exam Four:44
-Home work: missed 4 (-48)
(Didn't know where this fit so I just put it here)

So I was taking a class this semester with a professor that has a pretty well known history of being unbearable to take. As I'm usually a good student I figured everyone was being dramatic and he really could not be that bad right? Like the university has standards in place to protect the students, but I was quite wrong unfortunately. I'll admit he's very intelligent and knows his discipline very well but the class is not a great environment! You must make an 85% on home work or you get a zero for that assignment, I feel like it's worth noting pretty much every time I would try really hard to not use sites like Chegg but I genuinely didn't have the ability to complete the homework without it! It didn't really correlate with what was discussed in class other than some of the formulas we're derived, but that doesn't exactly aid me with indepth application. A couple of times I did attempt to go to his office hours and it was okay, but taking 19 credit hours and working 20-25 hours really doesn't leave me time to just live in this guy's office hours like I would've preferred.

Test average seems to be somewhere between 44-54 area but he is very vague with his feedback. I would either be right above the average for the class and for one I was just below(that test was average around 44 and I made a 40)

Now my university designates a specific date where you may drop the class and only receive a W, not great for the transcript but better than a failing grade. So I go to his office day of the W date, and his grades aren't put together to give me a good answer on my standing so he tells me to come back the next day, after the W date. I go back the next day, he says follow up at the end of the week. I go about a week later and he tells me I need a 50 on the final exam to receive a B, so I'm pretty ecstatic! Before I leave I made sure to ask that was everything and he confirms. 

So I begin prepping for my final, I end up making a 44, not the greatest but I'm only 6 points lower than what I needed, and after this semester with him I'll take anything that's passing so I was glad but I decided to email him just to verify I was still passing, so I email. He emails back and say I'm about 20 points (out of 500) into the D range. I'm completely surprised! I don't understand how I've gone from potentially making a B to failing this class...

I've tried talking to him but between me being not the most socially adept, or familiar with how to handle this, and him not being the most inviting personality I've gotten pretty much no where.

I suppose at this point I'm really not interested in getting a better grade(I genuinely don't feel like I have learned the course) but he really does a poor job at explaining what your grades are after tests. We use webassign and he only posts the raw grades, so at no point in the semester did I really understand what is going on. So I'm curious if I have any sort of standing to at least have his class changed! The environment is so bad, you always feel as if you are failing because grades are so bad and he gives very poor feedback. Is there anything I can do to have his class seriously looked into? It really doesn't seem like he respects the students and I always felt like my true grade was behind a door I was able to open. No one I've talked to has actually gotten a direct grade from him. He only will tell you, ""you need to make 'this' before the curve"", ""you need to make 'that' before the curve""

If you have any questions please let me know, I'm genuinely looking to try to make this class fair in the future, I'm almost willing to take the GPA hit even though it really does seem like a weird situation I'm an adult and willing to admit I shouldve kept up better with my homework.

Repeatedly they would tell me ""It's not big enough"", but I've literally just found 3 papers from the last few months all containing practically the exact discoveries I made 3 years ago. Previously I didn't care but this has actually angered me.

I am the only person I know in my whole department who finished their studies without a single authorship (first or otherwise) and even some Masters students have more publications than I do. I'm also concerned that other people could publish my work after I'm gone and simply take credit for it, because there is favouritism in the department and I can see certain people moving on my work when they get the chance.

Is there anything I can do with my remaining material? Should I start trying to draft a paper (even though I've never done this before) or appeal to my supervisor(s) for help?

In all honesty I'm pretty jaded with academia at this point, it just feels depressing knowing that I did 5 years of work and essentially it's like it doesn't even exist to anyone except myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a very confused undergrad that has just finished her last exam ever in university. 

I'm hoping to ask for advice on how to choose my future path in academia. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did a degree in life sciences and a final year project in a molecular lab. For the most part of my undergrad life, I was quite unhappy doing ecology and took interest in a humanities subject. I managed to finish a minor on this subject and was so interested that I took extra credits and honours-level classes. Then I had a crazy idea to try and apply for the Master's programme. So I wrote a proposal, found a potential supervisor who kindly supported me and found out that I've been accepted into the programme with full coverage and a stipend for teaching undergrad classes. But during my final year project, I found that molecular research was quite interesting though I am not very good at it. Still, I find the humanities subject a lot more intriguing and I can see myself not getting as tired, stressed and upset.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really tight on finances right now so the low stipend from the humanities department is definitely a problem. If I were to go into sciences, my plan is to work a few years as a research assistant before applying for a PhD programme, so financially that is a better option. Also, I have a three-year bond to work in this country (I am a foreign student) because I had my tuition fees deducted as an undergrad, so the Master's programme in humanities would also mean that I am delaying paying this off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Academics of reddit, is pursuing something that I would love to do although it is filled with financial/administrative difficulty a wise choice? Did you find that a choice you made was worth it? I am really scared because going down either path feels like there is no way back.

However, the past year, I have been losing interest in cancer inhibitors and instead gaining interest in neuroscience (especially systems/computational neuro).

49,49,bnql1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/bnql1m/something_about_this_collaboration_feels_very/,Something about this collaboration feels very sketchy; would like your thoughts,"I have been having issues with a research collaboration and even though I'm not in academia (half of my time at work is allocated toward my own research projects and research collaborations), I thought that those in academia would be able to provide some helpful insight.

In January of this year, this collaborator had requested my help with an abstract she was planning to submit to a conference taking place in the spring.  She is NOT my boss; working with her is not an essential part of my duties for my job, and I am not funded by any of her grants.  Therefore, I had the freedom to turn down this collaboration if I had wanted; I agreed to help as a favor for a colleague who was too busy to help this collaborator and for purposes of relationship-building, good karma, and adding more to my publication count.  I had worked with this collaborator in the past, and had problems with her before, including rude, passive-aggressive comments about how I didn't respond to her e-mails quickly enough, and an incident in November, when she sent me a request for help with an analysis for another project and gave me less than six days to do it (I had not known about this project at all before her request, and the deadline was a hard deadline because it was for an abstract submission).

But nonetheless, I agreed to help her.  Initially, I didn't really think there was anything out of the ordinary going on.  Here was the rough sequence of events leading up to a very unpleasant exchange on Friday:

* Early February: I give her all the material she needed from me to complete the abstract.  She submits the abstract and I assume that I could take a break from this and devote more attention to my other projects.
* Mid-February: she keeps asking me for more analyses.  This happens several times; I didn't think they were time-sensitive given that we had already submitted the abstract.  But I try to be a good collaborator and give her the analyses she wanted.
* Late February: I hit a particularly busy time with my other work and I don't respond to her request for an analysis quickly enough.  She sends me an e-mail telling me that I need to respond to her within a reasonable time frame and sends me a list of more tasks to complete.  I send an e-mail back saying that I wasn't aware that any of this was time-sensitive given that we had already submitted the abstract, that other work was keeping me occupied, and that her project was not the only thing I had to do.  She then tells me that this was for a manuscript she was planning to submit in a few months.  This is the first I have heard of this manuscript, and I ask to see a draft of what she has so far; she responds that this was a plan (no draft or outline yet) and that I was to get everything she asked of me first, and then she would send a draft for my review.
* Early March: I do some of the tasks she asks of me, but I'm lost, because I'm not sure of what she wants in this manuscript.  I send her some updates and ask her what the research question underlying this manuscript is to be, and tell her I would really like to see an outline or something.  She ignores my question and reiterates her request for the remaining material from me.  I tell her that I will not do any more analyses until I see an outline or an initial draft and a research question; I emphasize that I'm only asking this because I want to get as much right as possible the first time around.
* One week later: a tense standoff between us ensues that ends with her sending me a very rough draft, which helps somewhat.  I look at the author list and notice it's three authors; I'm second author, and this is the same as the author list for the abstract she submitted in February.  Over the next few months, and after a few calls back and forth, I complete the remaining tasks she requests of me.

Yesterday, she e-mailed me with picky details about the plots and tables I gave her.  I asked her why what I had included was not sufficient, and asked for clarification on what she wanted.  She gave a response, and said in her e-mail that ""she thought she had already explained it to me.""  She also said that some ""labels"" in the plots were wrong, and that I was to let her and some other colleagues handle it.  I wasn't sure what the ""labels"" referred to.  Included in her e-mail was a request to ""please provide the analyses that they wanted, and that I needed to the analyses just like my predecessor did.""

I sent an e-mail asking who ""they"" was and what parts of the ""labels"" were wrong.  She responded with a very brief sentence that ""they"" were the investigators that initiated the study; I have reason to believe that ""they"" does not include the first author of this manuscript, and this is also the first time I was aware of the involvement of these investigators.  Meanwhile, she ignored my question about the ""labels"" and asked me again to make the changes to the tables that she requested.  I sent her another e-mail asking for the names of these investigators so I knew who I was working with, and telling her that it would probably be much easier for everyone if she told me exactly how she wanted me to do the plots and what she wanted to say in them so I could make the changes myself.  Her response was, word-for-word:

""BulletproofHeart2003,

You are really not easy to work with.""

So anyway, something about this entire situation really does not sit well with me.  It's more than just my frustration, her having little respect for my time, and her ingratitude; the fact that she not only get defensive when I asked her questions about who was involved in this and how I could help with these plots, but got rude makes me suspicious about what really is going on.  For example, why was the identity of these investigators such a big secret?  Also what was really strange was that they were left off the author list for the initial abstract and were not included in the author list for this manuscript; if they had initiated the study, shouldn't they have been listed as co-authors also?

What are everyone's thoughts?  Feel free to be as blunt as you want.  I'm planning to go to my boss and explain the entire situation, and ask that further requests for collaboration from this person not be directed toward me.  I am seriously considering just walking away right here and now from this collaboration; what would be the ramifications?  I should also point out that this woman was recently caught submitting an abstract using her collaborators' data that had not yet been published, without their permission; given her previous unethical behavior, I feel I have another reason I have to be concerned.  I just feel that not only am I being jerked around, but given all the lack of communication and information asymmetry, I honestly do not trust this collaborator.",9,12

How legal is this?","As the title states, my professor, who happens to be the Dean of a college at my university, hired me to be his TA in my senior year of undergrad. I accepted, thinking I'd be taking attendance and helping facilitate class discussions. 

As a disclaimer, this is an upper level English literature course, and the maximum number of students we can have is 25, so this is not one of those big lecture classes. It's very intimate and we spend most of our time engaging in round table discussions and I know all of the students personally. 

The professor teaches 2 different literature courses--one in the fall and one in the spring, both of which I had taken and passed with flying colors prior to being the TA. 

For the past two years (senior year and 'super senior' year) I have been the TA for both the fall and spring courses. My goal is to be a professor eventually, so at first it was like a dream come true. I weighed in a lot in making the syllabus and choosing the readings every semester, I take attendance and facilitate discussions daily, and I'm always active and present in the class. 

However....

I also assign and grade all of the papers (of which there are 6 per semester), I help make the final and midterm and grade them on my own, I make pop quizzes, I answer all of the student questions/emails because the prof is unresponsive, and I often have to ""cover"" for my professor because he's not prepared, hasn't read the text, isn't interested in the class because he's the Dean and has tenure. I have access to all of the students' grades, since I am the one who keeps track of them, and my professor opens my gradebook at the end of the semester to manually input the grades into the school system, which I obviously do not have access to. While I don't mind essentially being the professor for the class (I do 95% of the work), I am not getting credit for it. All 100 of my students in the past 2 years have told me that I have essentially been the instructor of the course, with our prof popping in and out for inspirational anecdotes that have very little to do with the class. While I am glad my students have had a positive experience taking ""our"" class, it feels really unfair that I do practically everything, and get paid ""okay"" for it. Additionally, I have been told by other department heads and people in academia who work in other universities that it is highly abnormal for an English professor with such a small class to hire an undergraduate teaching assistant for an undergraduate course, and I'm beginning to wonder if, when I pursue a PhD in the future, this will hurt to have on my resume. 

The only undergraduate TAs I know are in the engineering department, and there are about 3-4 for classes of 100+ and they just help with assignments, take attendance, and hand back graded pop quizzes. I have never met or heard of another undergraduate TA who's as involved as I have to be. Again, I don't mind this work, as it's a wonderful opportunity for someone who's 21-22, but I'm beginning to question the legal aspect of it and wondering if it's going to hurt me in the future, rather than be a huge stepping stone for graduate school. 

Right now I'm looking for insight and advice. 

To clarify, the professor/dean is in his 50's-60's and I was his student when I was 20, became his TA at 21, and am currently 22 and most likely not going back to being his TA after the spring semester is over.",32,10

I'm working in a large research group that has lots of PhD students.

First off, why do I feel I lag behind my fellow students? Because all other current PhD students in this group, from 1st-year to final-year, have won a poster prize or a talk prize at a conference or have published at least one paper. I've done none of those things. And they all have given a seminar on their PhD project during our group meetings. Again, I've never done that. 

So why haven't I done any of those things? Because I haven't made substantial progress in my project. So what's in the way? My supervisor and I are exploring a research area he's unfamiliar with, so the progress is really slow. When he decided to take me on as a PhD student, he told me about the project I'm gonna do, which is within a subfield he had been doing for decades. But after I got here, he changed his mind and became interested in a subfield he doesn't know much about, so he told me to do a project in this subfield. And it turns out we've been doing it slowly. Actually in our department there is a PI who's familiar with this, but my supervisor never talks with him, and I don't know why. I happened to talk to one of that PI's students, and I found that what I'd been doing was significantly flawed. That means I wasted almost a year. I feel quite annoyed - why isn't my supervisor collaborating with that group? He himself knows little about this area, and he's been wasting my time! Now it's almost the end of my second year, but I feel I've learned nothing from my supervisor and made no contribution to human knowledge. By comparison, the other students in our group are all doing things familiar to the supervisor and have made lots of progress. 

Although I've been feeling bad, whenever I felt like asking my supervisor to change my project, I failed to do so. One reason is that I find my supervisor's really passionate about this miserable project; the other reason is that, if I manage to get a new project, I'll probably have to start over and spend three more years to finish my PhD - that's too costly!

My work is good for a college student (at least that's what professors say). However, I'm pretty sure it won't be published in more professional and competitive journals. 

I just want to get a feel of the publishing process and start having my name published somewhere. 

Do you guys know any small magazines that accept papers from college students?

  So, I am a postdoc at a highly ranked institution. I started last summer and upon arriving here, I started dating a very kind man, we are moving in together soon. The kicker is that my boyfriend's ex-wife is a colleague and acquaintance of my bosses. He boyfriend also met my bosses with his ex. They had an AWFUL, NASTY divorce, and I can imagine that a lot of people do not think highly of my current boyfriend, whether it is warranted or not. As shallows as this is, I am scared that dating him will hurt my reputation. I don't know want to be known as the job candidate who is dating so and so's ex-husband. To my knowledge, my bosses, nor his ex or any other professors for that matter, do not know we are dating, but I feel I need to tell my PI in secrecy before she finds out in other ways. 

A few questions:

1. Am I overreacting? Will people really see me this way? I need a job in lots of ways, and I can't hurt my career. The desperation here is real...  
2. I am thinking about telling my boss after I get one pub out... I am in a small college town, and people are starting to realize that I am dating someone. Should I tell my boss? She will likely find out eventually... Does that sound like a reasonable plan?

96,96,btyonb,/r/academia/comments/btyonb/update_on_my_shady_collaborator/,Update on my Shady Collaborator,"Thank you to those who commented on my previous post about this research collaboration gone sour. For those of you who have not read it, the link to the original post is here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/bnql1m/something\_about\_this\_collaboration\_feels\_very/](https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/bnql1m/something_about_this_collaboration_feels_very/)

It seemed that almost everyone was in agreement that this collaborator’s behavior was seriously problematic, that I should have never got involved with her in the first place, and that I should terminate this working relationship as soon as I could.

Even before I had written that post, I was strongly considering immediately stopping all work on this project, letting my direct supervisors know that I never wanted to work with this person again, and telling this collaborator that I was done. Your responses solidified that decision for me. Looking back, I really should have paid attention to the warning signs like some have said; my mistakes were really giving her one too many chances and trying to make everyone happy (two things that I have been very prone to defaulting to, many times even at my own expense, but that’s another story for another day). I now realize fully that this was a very unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship; these were not typical disagreements or quibbles. Considering that I could see no way to salvage this working relationship and that the reward for me for sticking with it, an uninteresting second-author publication, would not really help me all that much, there really was no reason for me to continue.

I wanted to wait until the dust settled before providing an update. And I felt the update is substantial enough to warrant more than a simple “Update: I spoke to my boss and bailed on this project; thanks for everyone’s input” at the top of my original post. This collaborator turned out to be much shadier than I ever expected; I knew she had committed at least one research ethics violation in the past (which I had found out about after I started working with her), but I found out there was much more.

The next day back at the office, the first thing I did was forward the chain of e-mails between her and myself (which included the disturbing secretive behavior and the rude comments) to my bosses and the colleague that referred her to me, gave my side of the story, and requested that I never work with this collaborator again. Not five minutes had passed before one of my bosses came to me and told me that nobody should ever work with this collaborator under any circumstances. It turned out that my boss also had worked with her in the past and witnessed her unprofessional behavior and questionable research practices first-hand. In fact, it had gotten so bad that my boss had walked away from a collaboration with her and refused to work with her again. If my boss had known that I was working with this person (aside from some uncommon cases which did not include this, I do not need my boss’ permission for research collaborations), she would have strongly discouraged me from getting involved.

From working with this collaborator in the past, my boss also knew that this collaborator was explicitly told by her direct supervisor not to work on certain types of projects. The project I was helping her with fell in that category (I did not know this before and this explained a lot of her information hoarding). This was also not the first time she went behind her boss’ back and worked on projects she was not allowed to work on; it turned out that a previous project I had helped her on (and one that I unknowingly took over for my boss) also fell in this “forbidden” category, and I was not aware of this either. My boss and I both agreed that I should just stop all work on this project immediately, especially considering this collaborator’s direct supervisor was the head of my division. This bothered my boss so much that she even insisted that everything be forwarded to the head of our division.

The first chance I got, I myself sent an e-mail to this collaborator saying that given her rudeness to me in her last e-mail and my concern over her information hoarding, I forwarded the e-mail chain between us to my bosses and that I was going to immediately halt any work on this project. I also requested that my name be removed from the manuscript in preparation and that she never contact me again for future research collaborations. She responded one day later with a curt “I will remove you from the manuscript.” And that was that; no explosions or fireworks, although I was prepared for that to happen. Just the embers of a flame flickering out.

Hopefully this is the end of this drama and I hope I never have to see or speak to her again. I’m seriously pissed off that she would withhold information like that to get somebody else involved in something she knew was not allowed. The possibility that a collaborator could do this never crossed my mind; I put a certain amount of trust in people I work with, and she seriously betrayed that. I could have also gotten in quite a bit of trouble myself as her unwitting accomplice. I’m also pissed at her rudeness toward me and her sense of entitlement toward my help and my time when I was working with her on something she was not allowed to do. Given her squirrelly behavior, I do also seriously question the integrity of the data I was working with and the project.

Fortunately, I will not suffer any consequences; my bosses both clearly said they were fully on my side, and disciplinary actions against me were not even considered. The same cannot be said for her; apparently, this was the breaking point after repeated problematic behavior, and now, she is in some serious shit. Whatever happens to her, she brought it upon herself and I have no sympathy for her whatsoever.",5,39

I'm in the humanities, and submitted a MS to a journal over four months ago.  Since then, I haven't heard anything, positive or negative.

(For context, I'm in the humanities.)

Question:  is it, at this point, acceptable to contact the editors and ask for an update?

I have a number of older colleagues that I formerly collaborated with, but as the years have gone by, there is zero benefit for me to do so - they show up to discussions, add comments here and there, but don't actively do any work.

I have been casually interested in Philosophy since my teenage years and reading on it quite a bit for the past almost decade.

About three years ago I started really zoning into a topic wrt my reading and thinking and as I got more into it I really wanted to go into a grad program for Philosophy to pursue this more academically. I found a grad program and started talking to their Director of Admissions. I took a couple of courses on the side at a nearby college, did well, and got recommendation letters. I applied to the grad program and got accepted to start in the Fall. 

In parallel, in the past few months I’ve found myself in the middle of a whirlwind of other really interesting topics, some closely related to my original area of interest, some only loosely related. 

The thing is that the people I’ve been talking to over the last several months are really intelligent, far better read than I am, and have mental models of many of these topics that have been making me half doubt my own prior mental models. 

More importantly, I’ve started doubting my own intellectual capacity and ability to pursue an academically rigorous discipline.

That brings me to my crossroads. What happened? I was so sure this is what I wanted and now I feel disoriented and unsure of what I’m doing. Should I just ignore all these other new areas of interest that have come into my life all of a sudden and return to the original area of interest and focus on just that?

I still really want to pursue the grad program, but I don’t know what to study or focus on. And I don’t know how to get through this comparison of self to others, which consistently results in self doubt.

Just wanted to ask this question as I think I’m in a bit of a unique situation.

I’m 26 and have just completed the first year of a Natural Sciences BSc degree with the Open University (UK), a distance learning university.

I have already a Bachelor of Laws (good ranked UK uni) and Master in Management from a similarly ranked (~top 10 uni) in France.

After working in business and law I found it wasn’t what I wanted to do, and remembering my old dream to become a zoologist, I decided to save money and pursue a Open University distance Bachelor in Science, with a view to volunteer and work in conservation at the same time internationally whilst studying towards my degree.

At the same time, I can’t help but wonder if, when I apply to a graduate programme for science, admissions might see my Open University degree differently compared to applicants with more conventional backgrounds.

Do you think admissions will have a problem with my background? Thinking of applying to Masters in Ecology/Zoology with a view to working in research.

One liked it, the other hated it. The editor decided to reject. I've done some reading on when it is appropriate to appeal an editor's decision to reject and many essays on the matter refer to evidence of bias on the part of a reviewer. I'm not sure if this is bias or what, but the reviewer who hated it seemed to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of the research. They approached the paper from their own discipline (human geography) and didn't appear capable of understanding that the paper was not meant to contribute to human geography. They applied standards of scrutiny to the methods that were totally inappropriate given the purpose of the paper and the nature of the results. They also admitted to not even reading past the results section (to not bothering to read the discussion section or conclusion). 

Is that worth appealing? Or can I trust that the editor would have read the paper too and been the arbiter since one review was positive and the other negative? I also have no publication history, so maybe that played a part too. 

But is what I described a strong reason to appeal?

Hello [chair],


I have an issue and the registrar directed me to you.

To make a long story short ill use bullets:


- In November 2018, i applied for graduation after fulfilling all requirements

- I've been receiving ""congrats grad"" emails and never received rejection emails

- I applied to jobs for about 7 months

- I found out i did not graduate, so many of those companies have likely blacklisted me for accidentally having a false resume

- I raised the graduation concern to Professor [X], [old academic advisor], and Professor [Y] (during a point of advisor transition)

- It was found that indeed fulfilled the requirement


However, now my grace period for my student loans is expired because i dropped full time status back in December 2018, despite only receiving my degree soon. I contacted FedLoan servicing, and they said if i can provide written proof of enrollment or proof of a special circumstance, then they can adjust my grace period. Could you perhaps do me the world of a favor and write such a document outlining this circumstance?

End email


 (Would they really want to admit fault??)

&gt;Sincerely,

Here’s how “Nicholas Wilson” replied … 

&gt;Dear lashend,  
Thanks for your suggestion.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Such a website cannot be maintained by only one person. Jeffrey Beall is just a librarian.   
Hence the maintenance and operation are beyond his ability. A similar forum can be created by   
any groups. Without the financial support, it is impossible for one website to appear on the   
first page of Google.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Many open-access publishers are listed there. The negative information may be removed if a   
large sum of money is paid by publishers.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;3. We're a non-profit organization. The publication fee varies from $200 to $290 for one   
manuscript accepted for publication. Compared with the publication fee charged by conventional   
publishers, it's cheap. Especially, a waiver policy is offered to many authors from low-income   
economies. Naturally, we are slandered by these powerful competitors. Nevertheless, thousands   
of articles have been released on over 1000 issues.  
For more information, please visit journal's homepage.  
[http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour\_charge.php?id=76](http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour_charge.php?id=76)  
  
&gt;  
&gt;4. To maintain the reputation of our journals, we have implemented a rigorous peer review. Only   
after clearing the peer review process is one manuscript accepted for publication. The   
editorial board for all journals has been posted online. With 55 journals and over 5000   
renowned experts, we are serving for over 100000 authors.  
e.g.:  
[http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour\_reviewers.php?id=76](http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour_reviewers.php?id=76);  
[http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour\_reviewers.php?id=93](http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour_reviewers.php?id=93);

[http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour\_reviewers.php?id=21](http://www.hrpub.org/journals/jour_reviewers.php?id=21);  
  
&gt;  
&gt;5. Based on the Jeffrey Beall's own assumptions, it's incredible that over 500 publishers in   
his list are predatory ones. What is his expertise remains unknown. Probably he is a genius in   
all academic disciplines like mathematics, physics, chemistry etc. All contents in Scholarlyoa   
are full of syntax errors. Even the name Scholarlyoa is a word created by his own imagination.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;6.Our journals have been indexed by some bibliographic databases (e.g. SCOPUS, EconLit, EBSCO   
A-Z, NSD - NorwegianCentre for Research Data, NLM Catalog, CABI full textetc).  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Five journals (Universal Journal of Mechanical Engineering,Universal Journal of Electrical and   
Electronic Engineering,Universal Journal of Educational Research, Civil Engineeringand   
Architecture, Mathematics and Statistics) have beenindexed by SCOPUS.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Four journals (Advances in Economics and Business, UniversalJournal of Accounting and Finance,   
Universal Journal ofIndustrial and Business Management, Universal Journal ofManagement) have   
been indexed by EconLit.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Besides, ""Linguistics and Literature Studies"" has been indexed by Linguistics Abstracts   
Online.""Universal Journal of Agricultural Research"" has been indexed by CABI full text and   
""Universal Journalof Public Health"" has been indexed by NLM Catalog.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;For more information, please visit the indexing page of the relevant journal.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, this person benefits from the following aspects:  
1. The negative information may be removed if a large sum of money is paid by publishers listed   
there.  
2. By defaming open access publishers, he will receive the reward from conventional publishers.  
3. We only focus on the assessment from governmental agencies and authoritative agencies in the   
industry. Any individual statements for commercial purposes will be ignored.

Recently, I was asked to review a paper and the title sounded interesting so I accepted. Upon receiving the entire document, I realized it was a review paper but I decided to still accept because I need to be able to do these things at some point and I was up to the challenge! 

However, this shit is awful.  There are two authors - a post doc and an MD. Clearly, the post doc is not a native English speaker (I know who the MD is and he is a well published native speaker), so its clear that the last author didn't even bother to read this before submitting. Some paragraphs (mainly the intro) are really well written, but most of it is riddled with typos and randomly organized, hard to interpret text. However, none of this is my big issue. All of this could be fixed with some proofreading and I don't feel people should be penalized for writing in a second language - I could never achieve that. 

My problem is that it is literally just a review of existing studies and random facts. Its like a textbook of random facts and at no point whatsoever do the authors postulate or synthesize anything. This would be a great bibliography resource for a new student or something, but the authors don't provide any interpretation, suggestions of a path forward, etc. So my gut is telling me to reject this paper, but I'm suffering from ""Who am ***I*** to reject these people"" and nervous about doing so. I'm trying to write up my review now and I don't know how to phrase things. Its not a structured review, just a place to write to the editor and a place to write to the authors. 

**Does anyone have suggestions for how I should phrase this rejection?** I feel like I really need to justify a rejection strongly, so I want to list 1) no synthesis of new ideas or information and 2) there are several other reviews recently published on this topic that did it way better, so these authors need to add something beyond what those other reviews did (which they did NOT).

I am just weary about this longing of mine to commit to graduate school. I had straight A’s up until my senior year—I had/been having a terrible bout of depression and just a lot of existential crises—and I’m just trying to recover from that. I’m also kind of weary as the last year or two of college I began to develop a more reclusive state as my depression set in. Losing my presidential position at an Honors fraternity, quitting my research position, and the decline of my connections to graduate students and professors. Basically I graduated in a really bad state. 

Now I feel the void that is no longer having my name actively enrolled in a large institution. I miss research and I miss not only learning, but actively thinking and understanding concepts and information not many care to appreciate. 

The way faculty worked and lived at my school was very interesting; it seemed like professors devoted most of their lives to their discipline. They definitely take work home. And I think I like that! But I don’t know if that is right for me. And it makes it all the harder a choice now that I’ve moved back home and am away from campus.",4,2

Well, I don't care about *that* opinion. Im a rising junior in political science, and I've approached many professors and graduate students at my institution, and they all say the same thing:

&gt;You won't get into graduate school. If you do, you won't get into a good one. If you do, you'll drop out before you finish. If you finish, you won't get hired. If you do, you won't make it past post docs. If you do, you won't get a tenure track position. If you do, you'll still be unhappy.

I want to address some of these individually

1)
&gt;You won't get into a (good) graduate school

For starters, that is a terrible reason to not even try. Maybe the chance is very small, maybe I have no chance, but there's no way to know unless I try. The only way I know I can prove you right is to listen to you and give up. 
Moreover, why do you give me such a small chance? We are sitting here at a top-10 institution, I have an above average gpa at a place known for its grade deflation, I currently have a research assistant position, and I've put myself in perfect position to receive a research grant from my institution to pursue my own research next summer. I have worked my ass off to put myself in a position to bring this dream into the realm of possibility. Why give up now?

2)
&gt;You won't finish

What evidence do you have to say that. Yes, something like half of candidates don't finish, but half do. I'm sitting here telling you to shove your pessimism up your ass, so what's to say I can't do that at the next level. Moreover, if I quit now, it's just as much of a failure to me. What is better: to absolutely fail now or to possibly fail in the future?

3)
&gt;You won't get hired/tenure

Maybe. Again, you absolutely may be correct. But, honestly, I don't give a shit. My goal is not to work in academia, it's to get a PhD. Id like to teach at the collegiate level of course, but I could also do something else. To me, the PhD itself has inherent value. Would I be subjecting myself to 5+ years of unparalleled stress for the purpose of a degree that has no practical application outside of academia? Yes, but I'm okay with that.

4)
&gt;You won't be happy

Nah, you're not happy. I'm sorry you went into a field you regret, but I'm my own person


So fuck you, I'm going to do what I want to do.



I'm sorry if this sounds preachy/entitled/anything of that sort, it's just really hard sometimes to push through the pessimism in academia.

According to the [Editorial Freelancers Association](https://www.the-efa.org/hiring/member-skills/), the average rate for “heavy copyediting” is $40-$50 per hour (with an average pace of 2 to 5 manuscript pages per hour and an industry-standard manuscript page of 250 words. That comes out to between about 3 and 10 cents per word. AJE’s standard rate is $31 for articles up to 3500 words in length –* one-eighth of one cent per word*.

Hello, I attend a private university in the Boston Area. This past semester I've been dealing with a lot of complex legal issues. My current fear is that some of my rights as a student aren't being respected. When I bring these issues up, I'm told that because they are a private institution they can do whatever they want. However, that's not completely true as they still recieve money from the federal government and are thus bound by certain stipulations. At this point, I think I should try to find a lawyer, but I'm not sure exacty what would be best suited for this situation.

This past semester I submitted two different Title IX complaints against 2 different faculty members. One for an event that occured 2.5 years prior and one for an event that occured a week prior. I submitted them both to the Title IX Coordinator, however, because they involve faculty I had to also report them to the equivalent of HR. I'm later told that these claims will be investigated by a private eye hired by the General Counsel's office and I should expect them to reach out. This was over 2 months ago and I haven't heard anything since despite several requests for updates. As far as I can tell they have no ongoing Title IX investigations.

Additionally, one of the men who I submitted a complaint about kept trying to have meetings with me after I informed his office of my intent to submit a complaint for sexual harassment. I was told that I couldn't refuse to contact him as doing so would be a code of conduct violation given his position at the University.

Though when I'm in the mood to write, I'm in this complete state of flow. I'm completely absorbed and when I'm done I can't even bear to reread it. I do a lot of editing as I write which is what saves me.

I have submitted undergrad essays like this and done well. When I get them back, I can't recognise what I've written. I know the content of course but not the phrasing. I also recognise a lot that needs serious editting. I don't remember much from the days I spent on the essays.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a PhD student at UW–Madison who has been suffering from the most severe depression, anxiety, and related imposter syndrome since starting graduate school. I moved across the country from California to work with my advisor here in Madison. I consider myself one of the luckiest people out there because of how supportive my advisor is and how generally cordial my colleagues are in addition to the fact that I am thriving academically, but I still cannot help but to struggle or to feel as if everything that I am accomplishing is for naught. I often liken my scenario to feeling as if I am treading water at times and going nowhere professionally, although I can notice my own progress and achievements in action. Nothing that I ever do is an end in itself. There is always something greater or better that I could be producing in the meantime.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is for those of us who have either left academia or have completed their PhDs and moved on, or those who feel as if they share my experiences. Do these feelings leave after one leaves the academic environment? Is this something that is specific to graduate school?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have taken the LSAT (scored decently) and will be applying to law school this application cycle, so my plan of leaving academia ABD is on the horizon, but I fear that these feelings will follow me afterward.",5,13

I lucked out and landed a non-tenure track job at a local school (where I completed my masters degree and have stayed in touch with half the faculty) and was almost immediately asked to take on our school's new undergraduate analytics program. This is huge for me as analytics is taking over our industry and this could really help my career. While my emphasis wasn't analytics, I have enough background to teach it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have spent the last four or five months very actively developing this new program. I even attended a conference in Chicago two weeks ago. The program starts in August and I was very excited. Meanwhile, they wanted to promote me to visiting assistant professor (still not tenure-track, I know, but I thought getting this program up and running was very important) but in our state all ""new"" positions have to be publicly advertised. The administration said this would in no way affect my fall teaching schedule and as far as they were concerned I was running this program for the next few years.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I got a phone call two days ago. The dean wanted a different candidate to take over my job. Immediately. So I am being let go. If I want I can teach a single class as an adjunct this fall, but that's it. I'm out either end of this month or Dec. I have no idea what I am going to do. I didn't finish the two papers I was going to work on this summer because I was working on this analytics program. I'm nearly two years post PhD with zero hits. And without a job.",15,35

To start, I should say I have not--by any means--had a smooth PhD experience or a good relationship with my supervisor during my 3 years. I have 1-1.5 years left to complete the PhD, which absolutely *can not* come fast enough.

I've tried to focus on going to more conference and meetings since time is running out. I know networking is important. My supervisor and professor have never really encouraged me to go to conferences--everything I've submitted and every conference I've attended has been on my own volition. However, recently my supervisor came to say he submitted an abstract to a conference and sent it to me for edits. I opened the abstract and I saw I was listed as second author. Except, the abstract is *100% my work from the last year*. To make matters even worse, he paraphrased half the abstract from one I had written earlier in the year--it is obvious if you read both. He had to ask me all sorts of details about it because he has no clue--he didn't even know how many samples had been used in the study.

I was also lucky enough to be invited this year to a meeting as part of an inter-governmental scientific policy group who work on something aligned with my topic. This year, they invited us to speak about our research as a sort of highlight. However, now my supervisor says I should ""focus on my work"" and he will go to the meeting alone since it's overseas. He doesn't want to burden me with having to travel. I now think this is just an excuse. And rather, he wants another opportunity to take credit for my work.

I think to add insult to injury, he is always giving me a hard time if I want to go to a conference. Just tonight, I asked if I could go to another in December and he basically said no--that it costs too much (my university *does not* have any funding issues and my project is massively funded). I was at one conference last week and he more or less forced me to come back early since ""staying for the whole thing is a waste of your time"". This particular conference is a smaller conference in exactly my subfield so it wasn't a waste of time.

But, up until now, I've never had the sense he is trying to actually take credit for my work. My question is this: what are my options here? I am listed as second author on the abstract for the conference and for the talk at the meeting I am sure he will put my name in tiny font on the title slide and that's about it. Am I within my rights to balk and refuse to provide figures or slides if I'm not there to even defend my work? I'm not sure what's the best way forward--I've never heard of this even happening to anyone before.",11,13

Basically I’m days away from giving my first public talk at a conference, on the first steps of my thesis work. Just for reference, my PhD is in radiology and my work involves NMR (i.e. MRI) for brain cancer. The problem is the whole time getting to this presentation has been stressful in ways I’ve never imagined. I just don’t “think” like an academic maybe, or maybe an academic biologist idk.

My background is in physics and engineering, and I *need* equations to understand things otherwise I neither get what’s going on, nor do I consider what was done to be rigorous. So I put equations on my slides to guide the process and I was told that those will put people to sleep. So I take them out and show my results only with some very superficial background  and then get told my slides don’t tell a story and are not scientific. I’m not arguing that the feedback is wrong but I just can’t conceptualize what tells a story without adding equations to the mix. I ask people but then they start asking about all my experimental parameters down to the nitty gritty and I say “I don’t remember” and then get a side lecture on how I need to know the data like the back of my hand. Or I’ll get asked “I’m assuming you also did such and such MRI scan to the animal?” And I’ll say “no” and then get scolded and that “i should know better” but the problem is I don’t know what’s good to do and what’s not because nobody ever tells me why we do anything, and I feel like when my lab mates forget to include certain scans they’re met with “oh ok”.  The literature also doesn’t explain the *why* for most things, and when I google theoretical explanations I find very qualitative answers.

The thing is I don’t think data/experiments are worth much if we don’t know the theory, but nobody else I work with seems to care about theory as much as they do results. During dry runs of my presentation I would get asked questions and not know the answer because I wouldn’t be able to formulate an answer based on theory, and would get met with disgruntled looks as the person who asked the question would say “You should know &lt;this random fact&gt;.” Meanwhile a colleague will present something that put me to sleep and get asked a question and then give a very hand-wavey answer and get told “Great job! Great answer!” So I don’t know what’s a good answer and what’s not, what’s a good presentation and what’s not, what’s acceptable to not know and what’s forbidden to not know. The things that I think are worth knowing are not generally considered worth knowing. What I think is rigorous is considered boring, and what I think is boring is considered rigorous. I answer questions with logic and get told that better answers use experimental results. I’m expected to warp my mindset to align with the masses but nobody is ever willing to challenge themselves and tackle things theoretically for my sake.

So anyway TLDR: my mind doesn’t work the same way as most other people out there and it has me frustrated b/c I have to cater to them while nobody caters to me.

However, some of my interactions with my professors have been very awkward due to my shyness and social anxiety around authority figures. Sometimes I have frozen up and not known what to say (I would forget my questions because I was so riddled with anxiety). Other times I have been so nervous that I forgot to even say hello when I walked into their offices (I beat myself up over that for a long time).

I'm trying to make a big effort to be friendlier just to avoid these awkward encounters and also to make my professors seem less intimidating to me. They probably wouldn't be as scary if I could just see them as regular human beings. I also feel like it would be beneficial for me to forge a strong professional and academic relationship with my professors, both in the short term and the long run.

What is the proper etiquette for being friendly with professors? I would never want to say anything that could be wrongfully seen as inappropriate or unprofessional. For example, if one of my professors had a picture of their family hanging on their wall, would it be inappropriate for me to compliment them on that? Is it strange to ask them what made them want to go into their chosen field of study? What would be some good conversation starters? 

I'm probably overthinking this way too much, but I really have zero social skills when it comes to authority figures. I live in fear of accidentally saying something wrong and offending them. Any advice would be appreciated.

26,26,ckcjim,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/ckcjim/seasonal_academic_positions_in_canadian/,Seasonal academic positions in Canadian institutions -- is something like this attainable?,"Hi there. I'm presently putting things in order for grad school, but I'm trying to come up with a long-term plan of what I'd like my future to look like. I very much want to do research, and the kind of thing I'd most like to work with is not particularly profitable or valued. (I'm studying plant/myco ecology, and the reason I'm thinking academia is one of my best options is because I would rather die than work in agriculture, management of lands/wildlife, etc. I do not want to forsake my very deep and special love for the natural world!) I also just thrive in academic environments, and have continually been told that it would be a great loss if I were to *not* become involved in research.

Thing is, I am hoping to get into a completely different line of work than research now. The job is a seasonal one (varies but generally mid April to mid August), but I'm pretty much dead-set on it because it fulfills me in other ways and will allow me a lifestyle that aligns with my fiance's. The seasonality of this job happens to be during the time most colleges, universities, etc have the summer break, but usually begins a bit early. I've looked at many academics calendars and the tail-end of spring sessions tend to overlap with the start of the summer seasonal job!

My questions..

\- Do academic institutions hire adjuncts / other teaching positions who can only work a single session annually? ie only fall sessions, as I am assuming spring sessions here would not be possible for me since the seasonal job starts up mid to late April..

\- If they DO, are people in these positions generally able to be involved in academic research? I don't necessarily care about directing my own independent research, just being able to participate in projects that feel personally meaningful.

\- If they DO NOT, are there any seasonal positions I could try for within academia that would allow me to participate in research, that aren't necessarily professorial in nature? Any outside of academia?

\- Lastly, how competitive are these kinds of positions relative to typical full-time faculty/professorial positions?

Just trying to figure things out here, and assess whether I should go for a PhD or not. I intend to acquire a Master's regardless. If it comes down to it, I will just settle for the seasonal job and try to fulfill my research interests/potential through other channels, like becoming very involved in a botanical/mycological society or something on the off-season, but if this dream of mine is actually attainable/possible then I want to keep dreaming!

Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2018.  Grawe developed a metric he calls the ""higher education demand index"" (HEDI) and uses the book to call attention to the very predictable shift in demand for higher ed in the US in the 2020s. His chapter on four-year schools concludes that:

&gt;Between now and 2023, the number of students attending a four-year institution in the two years following high school graduation is expected to fall within 2 percent of enrollment levels today. Following this period of stability, **the HEDI shows a 7 percent rise through the year 2025 before the weight of the current birth dearth reduces enrollment more than 15 percent in the latter half of the 2020s**. In just four years, at the end of the forecast horizon, the four-year sector stands to lose almost 280,000 students.  
&gt;  
&gt;Accounting for both the brief increase and the subsequent decline, the model predicts approximately 150,000 (or 10 percent) fewer students in 2029 than today, a contraction only modestly smaller than that predicted for college-going in general.  \[Grawe, p.69; emphasis added\]

So while almost all US schools are hoping to see enrollment growth over the next decade, and basically everyone's financial models at least assume stable enrollment, we should expect a 10% *decline* in net enrollments by 2029. The bulk of that will come after a modest demographic bulge exits the system in the mid-2020s. These impacts will not be spread evenly among all colleges of course; the elites and well-endowed will do just fine. But some schools will be unable to weather such a storm-- if a school with 2,000 students realizes a net tuition revenue of $20,000 (on sticker price of $40K and a discount rate of 50%, let's say) that 10% decline would mean a $4M reduction in revenue with very limited corresponding savings due to high fixed costs (since they can't ""unbuild"" residence halls and the odds are the missing students will not come from any one department, so there may be no savings in faculty salaries either).

How many of our four-year colleges are preparing for this very predictable-- and likely permanent --decrease in demand? What if some version of ""free college"" actually makes it into policy, thus further eroding demand for private higher ed (and likely four-year public as well)?",17,26

Both are excellent places.

One of the supervisor would be the same person who supervised my undergraduate thesis.

He constantly inspires confidence and trust in my skills and seems that he is grooming me to maybe follow in his steps. Overall, a great guy. He is well known in his field, has a well developed network across US-Europe-Japan, is the editor in-chief at one of the leading journals in the field, is the Chair and Director of the department and was the Head of one of Europe's leading history society for a few years.

Even with all of this, I am thinking about whether it would be worth considering taking a year off and applying to Ivy Leagues and other top US universities. I talked about my research proposal widely with US academics and I have been actively encouraged to apply by professors at Princeton, Columbia, and Pennsylvania. I was always curious about the US system and attracted by its resources. I know the graduate admission statistics for these top US ones are insanely competitive and the risk of not getting a place is high. I would like to have a career in academia and would like to know if you think it would be worth the risk in applying for an Ivy League PhD or accept the offer I have been presented with?

Now the question: as I get ready for another year of advising grad students, what, if any, are the equivalent non-academic careers for PhDs? I don't necessarily mean high-paying jobs, but there have got to be employers out there who want people that write well, have good critical-thinking skills, and have the determination to see a long-range project through to completion.

I have conducted an extensive literature review and analysis, which included identification of key documents (and obviously their publishers as well). Based off of these findings I conducted interviews to gain insight on whether major stakeholders/ actors involved agreed with the findings, ie. the current summation of available literature, or not, and what their ideas for the future might be within this context. The interviews were conducted with a combination of those whose publications were analyzed in the previous stage as well as other key stakeholders whose publications were not selected for analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering, first, **what qualitative method I can use to justify my selection of stakeholders/ interviewees**, given that I have already conducted extensive data analysis, and do not have time to put together an in-depth stakeholder analysis - so far, however, I have completed the first 3 steps of a traditional stakeholder analysis, and held a meeting with a major stakeholder (who wants to remain anonymous) to confirm my selection of stakeholders interviewed. But step 4, or ""adaptation of tools"" seems to require another full-blown analysis. I can't just leave 4 of the 7 steps undone... but I already have what seems like a solid start here. Any ideas on a different qualitative tool that could be adapted to this?

&amp;#x200B;

Second, is the interview section. I am coming up short in terms of a **valid qualitative tool to analyze my responses** (also that doesn't require another in-depth analysis) **from my brief interviews** (including 5 interviewees, each in different positions, from different organizations). In the interviews I briefly summarized my findings and asked for elaboration on whether they agreed or not, had something else to add, saw certain trends or gaps, or recognized certain elements with potential as future solutions.  Again, are there any ideas on how to adapt a qualitative tool to analyze or summarize this?

I’ll be starting my masters this winter or next summer (and have plans for a PhD) and am wondering if anyone has experience with accommodations for not being able to give lectures/presentations?

I have narcolepsy with cataplexy that triggers panic attacks which makes it very difficult to stand up and give a talk. I struggle to stand under pressure because the stress causes my knees to buckle (cataplexy). And I lose feeling and some function in my hands (I shake like a leaf and struggle with things like clickers or drawing on a board). I also have to type out my entire presentation. I may not end up reading it verbatim but I need it to reference in case I go full narc and forget what I was speaking about mid sentence. 

The embarrassment of all this also just makes it very hard to speak and I end up a shaky mess on the verge of tears, barely able to remember my own name. I made sure to fast for at least 12 hours (so I can’t anxiety puke at the podium) and took shots of vodka in undergrad to get through some 5 minute speeches. I managed to get a pass on my senior thesis presentation because I was scheduled for an MRI at the same time. 

I am still shakey but okay if there’s only one or a few people in the room and I can sit down/am near an open door in case I need to bolt to the restroom, but I can’t even fathom having to present at a conference or having a public thesis defense.

Some details: I did a PhD in behavioral neuroscience, defended my thesis, all good. I didn't want to go back into research immediately for a couple of reasons, which might not be important:

* wanted to travel a bit, because if I get a post-doc, then another, then a position in a lab, I'll be 70 and then I won't really be in the mood or in the shape to travel. So I backpacked around for a few months
* wanted to see what exactly I want to work in next. This was important, as it lead me to completely change the direction from neuroscience to longevity research (I have a MSc in molecular biology, so it's not super out of reach)
* during my PhD I was already in the process of starting a kinda-business\*, completely unrelated to academia or science in general (for the sake of it, let's say it was digital asset creation and management)
* I started getting panic attacks 8 months ago, which really slowed down my progress in reading and researching about the new field I want to switch to

So I have a ""gap"" of 20 months during which I was scientifically unproductive, but was productive in other areas. Do I just leave a blank space in my CV or do I state that I was in the process of building a kinda-business (which is still operating btw) unrelated to science? In how much detail should I go?

&amp;#x200B;

\*I'm describing it with the ""kinda"" prefix because it's not a registered entity or anything, it's just me and one of my buddies doing ""digital work"". I was able to survive these 20 months precisely because of that kinda-business, because, on average, it earns me around 2x of an average PhD salary (in Europe). It's passive income and keeps earning me money, but it needed to be built and maintained. Now when that's done, I'm ready for the next step, which is - research.

94,94,cho4at,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/cho4at/msw_vs_med/,MSW vs. M.Ed.,"Hi all,

 I am researching possible directions for grad school.  I had been seriously considering a Master of Social Work program until yesterday, when I ran across the Administration and Supervision, Higher Education Specialization program. I do a lot of volunteer work in the social justice realm, but I know social work doesn't often pay well nor have guaranteed job stability. I know there is a lot of work to be done in reforming the education system, but I also know the higher ed system can be a nightmare to work in (I have been support staff for a couple of years). I don't want to be a clinical social worker; policy and administration would be a better fit for me. Also, the MSW is a *very* rigorous program and I have concerns about my ability to complete it while working full time. 

I really enjoy working as a staff member, but I find that I’m lacking the skills and/or theoretical knowledge to foster success for students in my position. I have all of these ideas to improve the experiences of my student workers, but I don't have the theory and methodology to adequately implement programming with students or supervisors. My background is not in education and I don't think I see myself in a teaching position, but I like the idea of working in higher ed administration. 

* Having already earned a bachelors in a very niche department, I’m weary of jumping into a program that will pigeonhole me into one market. Is an M.Ed. at all marketable outside of the education system?  
* Is it frivolous to apply for the M.Ed. (which requires three letters of recommendation) if I'm not 100% sure it's the program I want to do? I'm concerned I'm being too impulsive here and I don't want to have to ask the same folks for letters of recommendation toward a different program next year. (The MSW only admits students in the Fall semester and I missed the deadline for this year).
* I work for the university at which I would be applying, so I get one free class per semester (4 per year). I've read that I shouldn't pay for an M.Ed., but an assistantship is likely not an option with my work schedule (I work M-F, 8-4:30). Should I pay for some classes, or just take a few years to get it for free? (There is a possibility that another department will pay for an additional class each semester).
* I have been using those free classes to work on a graduate certificate while I figure out the full program I want to do, so I haven't been completely out of the game as far as classes go. (It's a certificate in Women's and Gender Studies. It is free to me and has been helpful in acclimating myself to academia again.)

They don’t write ‘it is proven that ____’ they just say ‘a gender stereotype is the attribution of certain beliefs and principles which ought to belong to men or women based only on there social belonging to the gender of either man or woman’ this is correct; it wouldn’t be anything else.

After contacting a PI and mentioning that I was interested in his work and inquiring about a volunteer position in his lab (undergrad), I was asked to attend a poster conference to learn more about the research done by the students of this lab. I have been to poster conferences in the past but only as a presenter. Any tips on how to approach this? What kind of questions do I ask the presenters from his lab, do I mention that I am interested in working there if anyone asks about this, how much details about the research do I actually need to know?",5,2

What is your workflow to avoid messy research?,"Hello everyone. Just wanted to know more about your methodology to organize data and export it to other formats when you do a research project.

I work in software engineering and most of my notes and research are in latex format and as I make experiments or discover useful data, I keep appending it on the file. It also has the added advantage that it's journal ready most of the time. [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) helps me keep it by chapters, but I've found myself wanting to query/process the data or export it to my phone for experiments.

I find [relational databases](https://www.mysql.com/) too obstructive due to the need to define the notes format beforehand and sometimes I want to change them on the fly or link them to references for the bibliography which may vary in size or format. Have thought of using non-relational but don't wanna invest time and energy on it until I'm sure it'd be adequate (plus don't see that many options for android parsing).

Have done some extremely fast documentations or notes using [vim + yaml](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yaml/index.htm), then query them in Python when I need to display them. And some other documents I've tried using [Restructured Text with Sphinx](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html) so that I can use the **make latex** option if I ever need to append it into a paper. But find more annoying to reference a bibliography in Sphinx when I could do it directly in latex and save a step.

Have also read that many enjoy using the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/documentation), but honestly I have never been able to integrate it into my workflow when it seems that vim + shell suffice. And so far I haven't read if it can easily turn into tex for papers so it feels not worth it for small projects or tests and even then, I still haven't been able to find the advantage of using it.

What is your preferred method or workflow to avoid a messy research? Do you have a favorite data type to store, parse and redact your research? Do you use some fancy project management application? I know it may be too much to ask, just wondered what's your setup.

**t.l.d.r.** What data format do you recommend that can be easily transferred, parsed, version controlled AND is human readable so that you can store and organize your research/turn it into papers?",4,6

Has anybody experience with this method? It seems like a very well thoughout idea and I will give it a go this year. 



How it works:

The book explains a methodology that can be implemented with any note-taking app (Evernote, OneNote, Joplin, etc), or even with pen and paper, to build a birthing pod of research ideas that can be used later when you need to start a new project. The core principle is that you, as a researcher, read *lots* of things, some of them not even related to your daily research task. Then, during your reading sesions, you'll come up with things that grab your attention or think that they might be cool to incorporate in near future projects. As a consequence, the methodology of the book explains how you can transform your research notes (notes on the margins, on a app, little bits in your notebook, word files, etc) into an standardized universal note repository (the slip-box, aka zettelkasten in German). These notes, once they reach critical mass will, will give you core ideas for future research projects.",8,6

I recently read [this article](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/why-do-nigerian-scammers-say-they-are-from-nigeria/) about why Nigerian scammers claim to be from Nigeria. I found this article very enjoyable to read, and I would like to know is where I could find more articles like this. What I like about this article is that this is accessible to the layperson but still includes significant thought, math, diagrams, and a good takeaway. It has the feel of an academic article (not Buzzfeed Clickbait, despite its leading title), but it's not incredibly arcane like many scholarly articles.

Is there a collection of such articles out there already? Articles with legitimate thought and math, but easily accessible by those who aren't experts in that field? I am especially interested in those that provide a mathematical model to back up their ideas. Any suggested articles, blogs, or original researchers would be appreciated.

Other examples:

So now I look elsewhere, is it fair game to submit such an article elsewhere? What might be some publishing options? The article has a focus on euthanasia from a population health perspective. 

I plan to write a very similar article critiquing another paper. There are way too many people that have read this paper but somehow misinterpreted the results. In my opinion, the reason for that is that the write-up was poor, has misleading statements, and important findings are left out of the abstract and discussion. Before I get started on this second paper, I  thought I'd confirm if something like this is also publishable.

9,9,cs5knw,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/cs5knw/my_experience_in_academia_sucks/,My Experience in Academia Sucks,"A lot of this is going to be unordered rant.

I think academia is a lot of bullshit. I can't tell you the number of times I've talked to a colleague about something I'm passionate/knowledgable about, and had them 'correct' me rudely. Most of the time they will know basically nothing about what they are talking about. This can extend anywhere from pop culture, to niche culture I'm privy to, to things in my field, to things wholly in my expertise. It doesn't seem to matter if they aren't even in my field, people will take shots at you when they clearly know basically nothing about the subject. It doesn't matter if they are senior to you or even below you as a student. There is really no limit that I've found for some individuals to try and one-up me. They could know literally nothing about the subject and they will still try to invent a reason why I'm wrong in idle conversation. I've has students aggressively try to argue with me that I don't know basic things about my thesis topic, and no amount of reasoning with them seems to make them not want to talk to me like I'm a fucking idiot. I wish I could say senior colleagues are a lot better, but the difference is marginal (a senior colleague is at least more likely to know what they are talking about).

The value of intellectual integrity is wildly low. If I try to qualify my statements responsibly with ""I think that"", ""it seemed to me like"", ""it might be"", or any other qualifying statement of sureness, people perceive me as inexperienced/unsure/weak. Meanwhile people will state shit that is simply not true extremely condescendingly without qualifiers. They will then not have the balls (or be completely delusional, I'm not sure) to own up to the fact that they guaranteed whatever they were saying. I once tried to communicate that I granted something was provable, but that it didn't matter in the current conversation, by saying ""That may be true, but..."", and I got yelled at that ""it's not that it may be true, it's PROVABLE"". Like, yeah dude, I fucking know it's provable, you have a PhD from a top school and you can't understand a basic modal statement?

My advisor has regularly said/employed motivated reasoning along the lines of ""this can't possibly work this way"" and ""this definitely compiles because I worked hard on it"". What do you know, it definitely ended up working that way, and your shit definitely did not compile. I've been told categorically false things extremely condescendingly, both in and outside of my field of expertise. Some of these have come at personal costs to me.

I've been told more times than I can count that I need to spend more time trying to talk to people. I didn't get taken seriously when I said that some colleagues were getting to the level of harassment/abuse. I once had a student above me randomly walk into the office and yell ""you want to quit already, this is too hard for you"" completely unprovoked while I was working.

It's fucking grating and has steadily made me lose confidence that competence is something worthwhile that gets you something in this world. It is legitimately depressing to wake up and know that ""experts"" in your field can't have basically reasonable conversations about a range of topics. Conversations that modestly bright undergraduate students could (and still can, in my experience) have just fine. You get a vague amount of clout and it puts your head so far up your own ass that it makes you a fucking moron.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the values/experience leading up to academia (research and conversations with other stellar students in undergrad) were completely separate from whatever this is. People were actually interested in learning, and willing to discuss things rationally and grow together. The quality of basic/idle intellectual conversation, or conversation about a shared subject of interest was far better as an undergrad. Everything wasn't some big brawl for ego points. I think the reality is that the more competent people actually went off and did worthwhile things in real jobs (or at least the extent it was about ego, people still were capable of basically reasonable conversations without having their heads inflated). At least that's my only explanation for what happened.

I should have just tried to get a real job instead of thinking that this process would be intellectually challenging/interesting/enriching/valuable. I could have gotten a basic job and spent nights reading/studying by myself and I'd probably be in a much better position as an intellectual and as a knowledgable person than spending the extra years in university to get yelled at, cajoled, and condescended to by people who hardly have basic critical thinking skills despite having however many publications or awards etc. It is legitimately depressing to think back to all of the unrelentingly dumb conversations I've had in the last few years and realize these people are looked to as luminaries or whatever.",23,14

I started off doing undergraduate physics in a university thats ranked okay and I did very well there (just to give an idea I got 94% in my final year dissertation).

I managed to get a masters place in a university comparable to Cambridge in theoretical physics and I just struggled a lot and my grades weren't very good at all (all my marks were between 50% and 60% and I failed 3/8 exams which is below 50%). I just found it extremely difficult because I didn't really make any friends so I was trying to figure out everything by myself instead of asking questions mainly because I was too intimidated by how smart my peers seemed and also I felt like I would be wasting the professors time by asking questions. I now realise this is silly and I should have just asked but I can't go back.

I guess now I have a small chance to redeem myself by doing well in the dissertation but I feel so unmotivated because I feel like I've just wasted this year.

I feel like a complete failure. My plans were to do a PhD after this masters but I doubt I will get accepted anywhere with those grades. Before I left my old university my project supervisor sent me an email hoping that I would do a PhD with him but I'm not sure he would want to take me on after the grades I've received.

They are making this point while finishing their own PhD at a highly-regarded university. They are making it to me, yet a third POC academic who has done okay in the university department.

Paper 5- 62.5%

I spent a long time on these papers and asked my professor many questions through email (online class), only to STILL fail them. With the 25% paper, I was told that I didn't write an essay, and that I only compiled quotes and references into a paper. She refused to read it over again. I only used 2 direct quotes on that paper. I offered to meet her during her office hours to discuss the grade, but she told me that she doesn't have any office hours. I asked her if I can submit them to her early to get feedback before the deadline, and she said that she doesn't offer feedback on papers. Okay, so after that score, I worked even harder on my papers to improve my scores. 
Then I received a D only a few papers later, this time her reasoning was that I did not fully answer the prompt. Because there is no option on the rubric to deduct points for missing parts of the prompt, she deducted points from my sources, even though I used all my references meaningfully. She told me that she would not review my paper unless I wrote comments for each of the sections she incorrectly deducted points for. I completed this task, and her response was basically ""While you wrote good comments, your actual paper did not explain these concepts well, so no additional credit will be given."" The comments were just rephrasing everything I had already said in my paper...
 The final paper in which I received a 50%, I asked her about 5 questions in email about the prompt to make sure I understood everything correctly. Spent a week writing it (not that it matters), but when I received my score and asked her about it, she replied that I missed adding in 2 details and therefore, removed 75% of the points for the sources section on the rubric. I offered to have a phone call or send her comments on my paper again, but she refused to even look at it. 
At this point, I told her that I would be pursuing a grade appeal. Do you guys think I have a case? The class averages for nearly all these papers was in the 50% range.",8,1

I recently broke up with my girlfriend who's an academic, and I feel awful. She's a really sweet person, but her life is really up in the air right now and I think she just can't think long-term yet. She's extremely stressed out- her current post doc position isn't working out (PI is a famous professor who's super uninvolved in her lab, and a few other postdoc a have recently left), and shes applying anywhere she can that will offer a work visa (she's applying for a green card). I, however, know that I want a committed relationship. I just finished grad school, am starting a stable job, and don't really care to move around a ton- I wanna start a life. She made it pretty clear that she doesn't want to commit to anything big for a few years due to her career, and I just didn't think I could be happy like that. As much as her ambition, thoughtfulness, and passion for learning and knowledge is inspiring, and she is a really kind person, Id be sacrificing my whole life (stability, friendships and family in my city, limiting my own career, etc.) to follow around an academic if things had gotten serious between us. 

I just feel terrible that I'm not strong or understanding enough to have a partner who's in the thick of academia and all this uncertainty. I know life isn't a Disney movie and am not expecting her to quit academia and come back to me of course. 

I guess I'm just looking to alleviate my guilt here. Is an academic + stable career relationship even possible? I know she really benefitted and appreciated the support of a partner through the chaos of her career, and I'm really worried about her. I'm brave but if I'm not really able to ride the academia thing with someone else psychologically, seems best in the long run to part ways? Ugh it just sucks.

TL;DR: I'm on a kind of Math post-master career crisis, trying to figure out if it's only some kind or minor burnout or if I really need a change.

\-----

Hi, Math student here. Recently got my master degree and I'm hesitant about getting a Phd. Even more, I'm absolutely messed up about my career future plans.

I'm an average student, neither brilliant nor bad. I'm also a musician. I've been playing and studying music since I was a girl, and I really really love that. Recently, I've resumed my music activity and it's turning a little more professional (before, it was all pretty amateur).

During the last year of my Master, I started feeling kind of sick about everything about my master: Taking my last exam took was ridiculously hard because I couldn't just get the job done. Doing my thesis took a simillar effort. I just got kind of sick of all, like really didn't wanting to be doing that, even having a really interesting topic to study, nice courses, and awesome advisors. I can't blame the master itself at all.

But my mind seemed to think different. Probably tired. Since undergrad, I've been many years in a nonstop studying and working routine. But on the other hand, this mental fatigue seems to vanish when it comes to music. A couple years ago, I allowed myself to engage in a little new music activities (leaving one of my jobs to get some free time) hoping that would help me to cope with academic pressure. Maybe it did, but also got really engaged with new musical projects, got motivated about taking classes, and a huge etc that I didn't expected. On the opposite hand, I had to do a huge mental effort to get every little task of my math work done.

Fortunately, I did it. Got my Master degree, forcing my mind to focus on that and promising myself a new reward: Taking a couple ""free"" months (i.e, not starting a Phd yet, no research activities, etc.) to recover and see how I felt about that. Maybe a Phd is not for me? or I'm just tired? I supposed that a little stop would help me to figure it out. Also, in that time I wanted to focus a little more on my music projects, for personal enjoyment in the first place but also with a professional perspective. I'm far away from making a living right now, but it might (or might not) be possible in a future... If I work hard to get over the missed time. The only clear thing was that I needed to stop and think.

Now, that time is over and I find myself facing a new teaching job (not a student anymore = no funding) and working on an article with my former advisors. Or at least trying to. That recovering time went off too quiclky and wasn't even a real pause. Now I feel like trapped again in the academic lifestyle, without really taking my ""musician holydays"", and even more confused than before. I feel absolutely uncapable of facing a Phd right now and, in fact, i'm feeling uncapable of working on any research. I'm supposed to be working on the same topic of my thesis and I can't even get little things done. Looks like this little break took away my last tiny bit of willpower. Of course, this is seriously affecting my productivity so I spoke with my coauthors about this (we still have a advisor-student like relationship). They understood it and told me it's normal, and told me to take some days (a week or so) off (no article-related work for me). These days are right now and it feels great. I'm just doing the same ""nothing"" that in the previous days, but with no guilt. My mind is getting active and curious again... But not about math. I've been doing mostly music related activities. Also facing some stressful situations around my musical projects but I feel strong enough for that.

So next week I have to get back to full math mode (teaching and researching, not just teaching). And I'm not feeling ready yet. On the other hand, it looks like a longer break will lead to even less motivation to getting back. Even when it's supposed to be a recovering pause.

Up to this point I have to say, I've considered the possibillty that academia and math are not for me and I might have a chance on a musical career, even if it's a little late for a change. But also, it might be also the fatigue tricking me and making me crave for a radical change. On this last months there wasn't a single day when I didn't daydream about just kicking out all the academic shit and and go full time musician.

If I go to my next meeting and tell this to my coauthors, I guess they will be probably cool with it. Maybe they tell me to get another week off, who knows. But I really don't know what is the wise path to take right now, or how much of this ""rest"" is enough to keep going without being too much (some colleagues warned me about the risk of taking a too long break and loosing training). Also, I'm still uncapable to say if I got really sick of math and academy or it's just a phase.

40,40,crr8us,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/crr8us/the_feminization_of_labour_market/,The Feminization of Labour Market,"Labour migration continues to be one of the dominant forms of global migration attracting numerous skilled and unskilled workers from the economic peripheries of the developing world to the economic centres of the developed world. It is generally assumed that these movements are male dominated due to historical reasons which have always put males in the forefront of labour migration. However, the gender perspective on global migration suggests that there are increasing numbers of female immigrants, in contemporary migration, joining the labour markets in developed countries, a phenomenon called the feminization of labour market.

According to Kofman *et al.* (2000:105), the feminization of labour market refers to the increased number of women in paid employment. It also describes the flexibilisation of labour for women and men, a fallout of the changing nature of employment where irregular conditions once thought to be the hallmark of women’s secondary employment have become widespread for both sexes; informal activities, sub-contracting, part-time work and home-based work have proliferated while rates of unionisation have declined (Standing, 1999; quoted in Kanji and Menon-Sen, 2001:1).

The increase in number is caused by the growing availability of job opportunities for women in receiving countries which has an impact on female emigration on origin countries; in other words, when the autochthonous female population of the receiving country experience economic upward mobility, two things happen: firstly they leave their household in need of care, and secondly they leave behind their low paid jobs; consequently, the need for female immigrants emerge to fill the gaps in the households and other low paid economic sectors where women are employed. This process, in receiving countries, leads to a female dual labour market characterized by the existence of an informal and deregulated sector for immigrants on the one hand, and a formal, regulated and high paid sector for the locals on the other hand.

I am a associate professor and program director for the PhD in a health services research PhD program. Our model is not to admit PhD students with a specific faculty member, rather we admit students and then work throughout their program to match them up with a research area, data source(s), and then researcher(s) to mentor them. Often these students are accessing health system data and so are working with faculty from other than our department.

We have a student who has been difficult to mentor: they have maintained an attitude that the faculty don't have anything to teach them (an air of superiority), expecting accommodations to be made, insisting on challenge exams instead of coursework (but then either not passing the exam, or deciding at the last minute to ""just take the class"", wasting the time of the faculty who graciously created an exam), missing classes often, failed the comprehensive examination on the first attempt (but passed on retry), just a difficult student (whose intention is to go immediately into industry as a data scientist) but continues to limp along well enough to not get kicked out.

I cannot find anyone willing to mentor the dissertation process and project - this student has alienated most of my faculty. I also don't want to do it personally, based on this student's attitude and work ethic.

I got this response:

&gt;If you can't handle your parents while studying away from home and only seeing them in the holidays while they finance you at an Ivy League then you can't handle academia. It's extremely challenging becoming an English professor, and you will face a lot trying to get there. Perhaps you should research the realities of becoming an English professor and then weigh up your options. View your parents as practice for what you'll need to get through to become a professor

Now, I understand that the field is difficult to get into and presents unique challenges, but what actually are they? Because it seems ridiculous to imply that they’re anything like the abuse I’ve endured. 

I replied this:
&gt; I actually don’t understand this. How is academia anything like having abusive parents? I’m prepared to do the academic work; I’m already doing research and helping edit syllabi and it’s my first year. I’m hoping to become more prepared to deal with difficult colleagues and students. (I tutor and work in a writing center right now to help me prepare for that.) I’ve also talked with multiple professors about how they got into the field and what it’s like and I understand that it’s hard. My friends in grad school and my professors have been through a lot, and I understand what it takes to keep going through that, but none of it seems similar to the abuse I get at home. In academia, is anyone going to come into the bathroom while I’m showering and yell at me until I cry? Are people going to tell me my dog is a better person than I am? Am I going to be screamed at on a daily basis? Are people going to take the locks off my doors and not let me leave when I’m crying because they’re yelling at me about how I’m a terrible person? Are people going to threaten me with bodily harm and make me feel unsafe? How does enduring those things make me more prepared to handle teaching, writing papers, and whatever administrative stuff I need to do?Seriously, if being an academic is anything like having abusive parents, I don’t want to do it.

And they doubled down, saying:
&gt;Again, I think you need to do some research about what it's like getting in to academia. I only finished my MA and I have absolute horror stories about my experiences. Seriously, read up about the reality of what it's like trying to succeed in academia.

The paper is in an international methods journal as part of a special issue co-authored with a colleague from another university. It details two case studies (both previously published in full elsewhere) in order to shed light on and illustrate the how such methods can benefit a wider community of scholars. One of the case studies that the paper draws on is published in full in another paper also included in our universities REF submission (by another colleague and the lead author of the paper). As the paper provides new insights drawn from two case studies, I would argue that this constitutes 'research' under the REF definition but I'm concerned that it may constitute a review instead, which wouldn't be eligible?

Any thoughts? Should I seek advice from a trusted colleague in my department? The internal politics are bad at the moment but there are a couple of people I could ask.

I didn't even know I could appeal it until my dissertation adviser said offhandedly ""well you can submit somewhere else or appeal..."", probably not even giving appeal much consideration himself. But I took that as encouragement and went ahead and appealed it.)

I appealed the rejection by replying to the editor. Now it's been almost 2 months since I sent that e-mail and I haven't heard anything. Not even an acknowledgement of my e-mail. Expecting the rejection to be sustained, I prepared my manuscript for a different journal and am just waiting for some finality from the first journal before submitting it again. Yet I don't feel like I can e-mail the editor about its status because from asking people (on reddit) about appealing rejections I was warned (after the fact) that it is a good way to damage your reputation. If the editor ignored it the first time, I don't want to bother him again. 

So is two months a good place to draw the line and assume it's not even under appeal?

So ______ is a PhD student who has finished courses, completed, passed qualifying exams with flying colors, and is in great standing in their lab as of the beginning of the Spring 2019 semester.

However. There is a new grad program committee head as of a few weeks ago. For some ungodly reason this guy looked at ____s transcripts from last fall and decided that he didn’t feel that the courses approved by the previous committee head were acceptable (he claimed two of the classes taken weren’t worth the credits the school had assigned them as so he is removing credits) and has rescinded ______s ‘completion’ of credit requirements.

Obviously this causes a lot of problems including putting a lot of new research to a halt if ____ has to go back to taking classes to please this one guy. They have been doing only research for a semester and a summer and are in the middle of some important things. They are pissed, their PI is pissed, but this guy won’t back down about it. 

In my experience it’s not ‘legal’ for schools to do this. You agree to the course progression that is decided when you start and any new changes only affect the students entering during that and each following year. The committee at the time the courses were taken approved the credits with no issue. Does this chair have the right to overturn their previous ruling after the fact? 

I couldn’t find any specific policies on our university website. Any advice before they head into a meeting with the guy tomorrow?

91,91,cx47dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/cx47dl/what_is_your_honest_opinion_on_accomodations_for/,"What is your honest opinion on accomodations for a student with mental health problems, but has a good GPA?","I was recently told that I would not be given accomodations on two grounds, my current good GPA of 3.8, and, what to them was a lack of ICD or DSM codes in the specific format they wanted.  I can correct this, in a few months time at the next PSYC appointment, but then I still have the issue of overcoming their objections due to my GPA.  

The GPA doesn't reflect a few facts:

* I benefited from academic renewal after four failures.  Counting these would result in a GPA of 2.77, and this is the GPA utilized by most other colleges for admission into their graduate programs.  The failed classes are still on my record, just not in my internal college GPA calculation
* I have had to withdraw from a semester due to mental health problems, but I withdrew before it was put onto my transcript
* the school's own counselor recommended I go inpatient, and said I should use ""medical withdrawl"" to do so.  
   * Medical withdrawl, IIRC, would prevent these things being on my transcript, but not in calculations for financial aid
* The added stress of explaining to instructors why I failed to get an assignment in on time, instructors either accepting it late or not, and then the huge added stress of compensating for these failures.  
* I was blessed with instructors last semester, who despite the fact that I didn't disclose my problems to them, never the less, I have reason to suspect they helped my grade.  One, I was one of the only students who participated in answering questions (sometimes interrupting before she was finished asking) and I was asked to allow other students to answer.  I then waited for those long pauses before answering.  The other I did the best they'd ever seen on an exit exam, probably thanks to ASD and some mania.  I finished in 10 minutes with 100% in comparison to other students who mostly got 70s, and took the full 50 minutes (this was a physics class)

&amp;#x200B;

My problems are numerous, and they focused on a narrow set of statistics which doesn't show the problems I face every day that are not encountered by my classmates who are gifted with better mental health than I am.  

Main diagnoses and related problems:

* ASD
   * anxiety
      * Giving presentations is very difficult, but tolerable
      * I have the general feeling of anxiety from the morning until I return home
   * social problems, poor grades in classes that require conversation in class
      * That english class where I did poorly because of this still bothers me
   * very shy at telling anybody when I need help, no friends in class to rely on for notes and help
   * This helped me in physics and math, courses I am no longer taking, but which contributed to my good GPA.  EX: last semester I did so good in physics ( [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/97d0/557e1f02f6e9b7f10a5d789c84cc653a8d8b.pdf](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/97d0/557e1f02f6e9b7f10a5d789c84cc653a8d8b.pdf) )
* Bipolar
   * Mania helped one semester ( the spring one)
   * depression did me in on two semesters (the last one being the summer semester)

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest fears probably cannot even be alleviated with any accommodations:

* withdrawl affecting student loans
   * repayment may become due the moment I am no longer enrolled half time, although I'm not sure
   * SAP may very well be affected
* academic difficulties affecting GPA for addmission into other programs not recognizing academic renewal 
   * there's probably no hope to fix the 2.77 GPA now

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions to you professors, and perhaps other students:

* would you disagree with someone who had these problems getting accomodations?  despite the high institutional GPA?  
* Should I not pursue this any further?  (my fear is when I need help, I will not have anything that says I can get it)
* Should I just get the documentation with the the codes to the accuracy they would like, and then, if they disagree again, note that the GPA doesn't take all the other things into account?",12,10

Things got bad when I noticed that my supervisor was a temperamental bitch  whose insecurities have to permeate through humiliating others and  disqualifying in mean ways. So, you know, he can reassure himself.

So  I wasnt really happy but still ok since he is almost never in lab and I  used to have a strong interest in producing some knowledge. Later I  started to notice how other supervisors are basically the same copy, a  bureaucrat who pretends to be scientist, pretends to be a leader and  pretends to be a manager while their subordinates get the job done. In  many cases with horrible treatment, like mine. But I was stuck by then due to financial constrains, I needed to lock that position while I worked on some other things on the side.

Ive  always had difficult to accept authority but this dude in particular is  the kind of idiot that oppresses others, even though, you know, he is  objectively speaking an idiot. Liar as well. 

Long  story short, he gets mad for instance if I show more advanced knowledge  than him lol. At  some point some people even saw me more as a leader because, well I do  care more about the science than how my name looks in a fucking piece of  paper lol.

Keep in mind that seeing your name in as many papers as possible is also what drives many people in this shit circus.

On  the other hand, not that I like to hang out with people, but when I  started to notice how the general atmosphere is complete misery, I just  decided to stay away from everybody. Away from the zombies.

I  still wanna finish this shit just because is convenient and it has  opened me doors that will benefit me for the rest of my life, dont get  that wrong, so I had to try to elucidate the causes of this fiasco.

How  my supervisor could be so incompetent and yet reach a good position in  something where performance and results are supposed to measure you?

The  answer is simple!!!. Because thatś not how you reach success in  science. You reach it by entering the mafia dynamic and licking asses  aaaall daaaay loooong. Yeah babe give me that ass, Im gonna lick it  because I also wanna be a professor.

It  turns out that academia and universities are nothing more than  student/article factories where quantity matters more than quality.  Incompetence is rampant even at those levels since it is damn easy to  get to do a PhD. Itś cheap and it has no value. Let alone a postdoc.  Just for perspective in some places an employee in McDonalds earns more  than a postdoc and gets more social benefits since a postdoc is  considered something like a student position.

He already mentioned that quite probably he will be able to get me some kind of funding when I'm there (only April), but I can't study in Germany without this funding. 

&amp;#x200B;

In November I'll be heading to Germany. This trip's purpose is to getting to know the university and having some meetings with my professor about his research proposal. This will be the best opportunity for mentioning my financial situation. How do you think I should approach it? Should I be honest and tell him that I wouldn't be able to study the PhD without funding?

I asked August 1st  if he could submit it by the 9th, but I said there was some wiggle room to submit it since I asked with such short notice. Within the hour he responded saying that he would write me a great review and try to get it in by the 9th but because he was busy, it might slip into the next weekend. Well the 9th passed, and I sent him a short email on the 13th asking if he could give me an ETA, and when I heard nothing I sent another email on the 21st... Still nothing. I'm kinda freaking out because I'm basically accepted, they just want to confirm my degree, but my advisor is not being responsive at all. How much more should I bug him? I obviously don't want to aggravate him. My program has not given me a deadline, but they have sent me two emails asking when I'll have my rec letter in, so I know they are waiting. I'd ask someone else, but they specifically asked for him.",3,5

I've been invited by my university to join Sigma Alpha Phi. I've found lots of conflicting advice. Some people say it's a useless CV padder, others recommend it.

Officially the document comes from the University but listed at the end of the report has all our names as contributors. 

Just wondering how to cite it? I was thinking of putting everyone's names but 

a) that's a lot of names in my field (the biggest pub I have is with 4 others and that's a bit of an outlier as my other ones have max 2 co-authors) and 

b) there's no 'authorship' and our names are all listed in alphabetical order (I could simply do that - but still point 'a' makes this a little weird and also my name is towards the end of the alphabet :P).

I could just write 'University of Name (2019) - Title of the report' or simply just 'Title of the report'.

Thoughts?

Thanks!",4,13
