I did however hate the courses in my college and I didn’t score so well. I was a naive kid back in the beginning of my undergraduate and didn’t think grades was of much relevance (I do realise how that’s quite the opposite). In my college system you can’t choose the courses you want to take, you can’t drop or retake the courses either (it’s mainly because of the lack of faculty)

I am in my third year of a four year undergraduate and want to really have a career in research but I find it extremely difficult as even while searching for research internship they are highly grade oriented. I do have two published paper and around three internships but I am not sure if that would help.

I would really appreciate any advice regarding what I can do currently to improve my profile.  Also how much weight will my undergraduate scores have in the future?

I love research and wouldn't want to do anything else even if given a chance. I have come across several post, blogs and rants about how there are no incentives in research. I do understand that there are problems with funding and it's not really an easy job.

&amp;#x200B;

Given that most of the people take loans for their undergrad and grad education, does it provide enough incentive to pay the loans back (please forgive me for my ignorance, I just came across this recently and wanted to ask these things)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, considering that I wouldn't really be happy doing other jobs, what do you think would be an ideal path for a researcher?

The dream is to work in a public health, social science, and/or interdisciplinary department at a small liberal arts college or balanced university.

I’ve TA’d throughout my time in grad school and have been instructor of record for one class. I also facilitated (basically taught) a course as an undergrad. I hope to get one to two more experiences as instructor of record under my belt, including one in which I can develop the course topic.

My advisor (the chair of the dept and an expert in our field) has expressed that getting more teaching experience is overkill. In her view, one course is enough to establish I can teach - and I do have strong evals from the handful of students I’ve taught. I could be using that time to publish instead - and I do want to get more pubs in the pipeline.

I’m curious to know what the community thinks. I realize that answers will likely depend on the schools to which I apply - but any insight helps.",13,7

Her project sounds very interesting to me, I honestly can't think of a topic I'd rather work on. However, the faculty demands a contribution of 5000 pounds from external students. I believe there are several reasons for this:   
\- She told me her department is very full and I can imagine that there needs to be a barrier from research groups taking on internship students, which are basically a free pair of hands from their perspective. 

\- Tuition at Oxford is 9200 pounds a year, so this fee (for approximately half a year of research) more or less equates to tuition costs. 

\- Oxford is a highly prestigious university and they can practically charge whatever they want.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be delighted to participate in this topic and the avant garde experiments they are working on. However, 5000 pounds is a very significant amount of money for me. Also, it feels a little wrong to pay so much for the free labour I shall be providing them. 

Now, my question is whether it would be worth it. Besides the great experience of doing research there, Oxford is a big name to have on my CV, and great for developing my network. What do you think? ",22,9

11,b1iao2,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/b1iao2/ma_oral_defenserant/,MA Oral Defense-Rant,"WARNING: This is a bit of a rant...

&amp;#x200B;

I've just gotten my notes from my examiners for my MA thesis in the humanities and am overall happy with their feedback. They were complimentary but were sure to point out some issues in terms of argument, primarily in one chapter. I wasn't put off by their notes but considered their engagement with my thesis  a good sign. I mean, their criticisms (to me) did not seem overly harsh. In fact, they mentioned that the thesis was thought-provoking and engaging before bringing up some shortcomings.

&amp;#x200B;

But today I met with my supervisor who ultimately said that ""I may not pass"" unless I write an ""amazing and nuanced"" opening remark. This person asked me to send them what I'm writing for my opening remarks (10 pages) and basically just made me feel like my thesis isn't good enough to pass. 

&amp;#x200B;

This person also knows that I have a job lined up as a writer following the defense and even made a comment that I need to ""be a good writer,"" if not only for the defense but for my future job... even asking ""how *did* you get this job?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose I am just hoping for some clarity. Is the MA defense really this grueling? I had always understood the defense as a sort of conversation about the project. Of course, I will prepare for the defense... but it seems to me that for some reason my supervisor just doesn't believe in my project or my academic abilities... even going so far to question what's next in my career...

This advisor was someone I was stuck with early on in my PhD career, and has been nothing but discouraging. He has said probably 3-5 times that “the PhD isn’t for everyone” and “You should really just consider leaving and finding another profession” despite the fact that my grades are good, I passed all my comps with high passes, and have excellent teaching evaluations and am respected by my peers. I’ve won multiple grants for my research as well. 

From speaking to my peers this is something he has done to them as well. (Though, without getting into conspiracy theories, he seems to disproportionately do this to female PhD candidates.) The point is, he seems like a miserable and unsupportive person. 

I recently received a VERY large grant that is one of the most recognizable (name-wise) and competitive grants in the country. I’m really excited and I sent a short, professional email to my advisor to inform him. I also informed the associate head of the program, who didn’t realize I’d already emailed him, and cc’d him on my congratulations. 

He is not acknowledging it in any way. Like, I’ve seen him in person, he’s sent emails unrelated to this, etc. The program I’m in is small and I don’t know of anyone besides me in YEARS who has won a grant like this. People in our college system (junior colleges) have won, but no one from our program. I don’t usually like to brag but this is definitely a big deal. 

Should I continue to ignore it, or say something like “Not sure if you’d heard of...” or send a follow up email? The thing is, he is the administrative and academic head of my program, so his support and willingness to promote this would be really helpful. I can go down other venues if needed but I also admit there’s a part of me that’s hurt that after years of working together (despite it not being the most pleasant experience on my end) he can’t acknowledge this huge honor.

I am submitting my first article to a journal soon that summarizes my masters thesis work. I sent it to my adviser earlier this week for his first review, and he sent it back with comments and added 4 other guys names to the article, 2 of whom I never spoke to once during my whole thesis work and the other 2 who provided tiny bits of guidance here and there. He never told me he was planning to do this until just this week. Frankly, I am surprised that he would suggest they all be added as authors when I did essentially all of the work. There is one guy on there that I can kind of understand, as he was helpful in teaching me how to code my data analyses. I have no problems with these four guys in any way, but I feel like this is fraudulent and am not comfortable with it. After getting to know my adviser, I don’t trust him to begin with so I don’t know if I am being too skeptical, but I know people who have contributed so much more to research projects and never had their name on those articles. I know it is common to see a lot of authors names on one paper, but is it right when one person does 99% of the work and some literally did nothing? Is this yet another case of men taking credit for a woman’s work, or is it acceptable to give people credit for work they had no part in?

Also, instead of fighting him on it (with his hot temper it will lead me no where) I suggested we add our female colleagues name because she provided more assistance than the other guys whose name he added. Normally I would not suggest adding her name for the level of work she did, but if he set the standard of how much work is required to have a name on this article, I’m going to fight for her right to be included. I think he overlooked her because she is another woman.

I'm really curious about others thoughts on name changes. I know that there were some threads in the past about this, but they've been archived and didn't have a ton of posts. 

I'm interested in how you perceive or your experiences changing your surname post-PhD? If you did change your name, did you keep the original surname as part of the full name, i.e. Mary Smith Jones?

In my field (Political Science) there are several well-respected female scholars that have at least 1 publication under their maiden name. Still, most seem to have married in grad school, because their name has been the same for most (if not all) of their career). I know others say it's best to always publish under the same name. I have even read stories about male faculty members who perceive female colleagues who change their names as less committed, but I've never heard these kinds of comments from people I know personally. 

Perhaps I'm overthinking the whole thing, but I thought it could be interesting to hear outside opinions.

My question is, is is acceptable to submit an 'Empty Review' (i.e. a systematic review with 0 articles) at Masters level?

1. I initially wanted to do an RCT, but the university did not have enough equipment.
2. I then tried to do a single-case intervention, of which the athlete needed started ghosting me when it came to data collection/intervention.
3. So I've had to settle on a systematic review.
4. After doing in/exclusion write-up ect. I found 0 RCT's, so opened my inclusion criteria to simply any article that involves my research topic (Velocity-based training). Using 3 databases I found 68 articles, of which 0 are relevant. I'm currently in discussion with my thesis supervisor on this, but all opinions are welcome.

The fall graduation is an artifact of some unfortunate circumstances, but I only have five courses left to complete. My CGPA is 3.23, and my GPA for the last few semesters (I was told many schools only look at your last twenty courses) is 3.55. It might go up to 3.6 with this last semester. It might not. 

I know at least four professors who seem very willing to write me fairly strong letters of recommendation(in Philosophy, Psychology, and Media Studies), and who were very impressed by my performance in their classes. I have presented two papers at the local undergraduate conference. I am hoping to get a third one published with one of the aforementioned profs over the summer, if I can. I have also done 4 independent studies and an applied study, which should count as research experience (at least one of them was on a fairly underresearched topic, hence the possible paper), and have been a paid research assistant to two different profs, in two different fields (Spanish Film and Digital Humanities). I don't have a very strong math background in terms of advanced courses, but I am taking metalogic right now and I have tutored statistics, through the school's tutoring program, for three consecutive years. I have also learnt to use MATLAB and R over the course of my undergrad. I haven't taken the GREs yet. 

I have already given up on a PhD, at least right now (I love academia, but I'm already a bit burnt out *now* in senior undergrad, so I would probably end up having a mental breakdown and moving to Tibet for a while. Plus there is the whole 3% success rate). Still, I would like to do a research-focused MA, hopefully doing something with game theory.

I don't really care whether my MA is in Philosophy, Psychology, or Economics. I have even looked into Legal Studies and Library and Information Science as options. I think all of those have about the same likelihood of working out for me, it being entirely dependent on finding the right advisor with the right research interests, since whichever program I find would have to be fairly interdisciplinary regardless. 

For now, my plan is to spend much of the summer contacting possible advisors, apply to places after graduating, and spend some of the interim working to pay off debt. I am internationally-focused, and so basically don't care about where in the planet a program is, so long as it is in a temperate zone and costs are minimal. So, mostly Europe, I guess, but hey if Argentina has an awesome program, I would love to go. I am academically competent in English and Spanish, passable in French, and I would be willing to learn another language for the purposes of doing the MA. 

Do you have any advice regarding how to prioritize which programs to look at (I already have a slightly-too-large spreadsheet of possible programs), contacting supervisors, and figuring out what is ""within my reach"" so to speak? Are there any red flags in what I have said that I should know about? Any professors, fields, or schools that I might not have included in my search? 

Thank you for your help. ",1,3

I recently came across a PhD position that addresses a topic that I'm very interested in. However, I have some doubts about it because:

1.) The program approaches it from a more cultural/social way (it is interdisciplinary but tied to the cultural theory dept) when I would like to so something more technical. I'm not sure to what extent I can steer the research to be the way I want given that the home university doesn't have such a high expertise in that area. 

2.) I'm not sure that this is the best path to take career wise. The PhD stipend is okayyyy but I could definitely make more money doing other jobs. I've worked in academic research for about 3 years before and I like it, but I'm not sure if it's something I want to do forever.

3.) One reason why I'm attracted to this position is that it will allow me to stay with my boyfriend in his country. It's a really silly reason but if I really value this relationship and want to keep it going. But if we break up then I'm not sure if I would want to continue with the PhD. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my question is whether I should apply to this PhD anywa?y  And will be repercussions if I were to start it but then drop out before completing it? I imagine it would look really bad on my CV. The second question applies to all funded PhD positions in general. ",4,3

Thankfully, I absolutely love my research and my advisor (for the most part lol) and that’s honestly the only thing keeping me going.

My problem stems from the following:

- I had to file 4 Title IX complaints against people in my department. The guys will *not* take no for answer. Some pursued me for over a year and became sexually aggressive or harassed me via text, even when I clearly did not respond to any communication or clearly said no to attempts to hang out. I would be approached in class, my office (showing up unannounced), or “dropping by” my apartment. I stopped showing up to class and required seminars to avoid it. I was not aware their actions were in violation of Title IX until someone pointed it out to me. 1 one of these people was a friend, another was a close friend, and another was borderline best friend. It seems to be a case of unrequited love, but that doesn’t excuse them to treat me like shit or ignore lack of consent. This happened over the course of the last 15 months and was just one person after the other.

- note, I’ve been asked out/pursued my entire life, even when I clearly had a SO and I’ve never had 6 people mistreat me because I said no. I grew up in CA, went to undergrad in NY, and am now in KS. Is this just coincidence or some weird midwestern behavior? Everyone I’m discussing is from the area or a nearby state.

- there were 2 additional Title IX-ish behaviors of people, one of them graduated, so I didn’t bother. The other has been chastising me for not texting him back after he gave me his phone number unprompted. I’ve been out of the country for 2 weeks and I’m dreading him stopping by my office and asking why I didn’t text him.

- I had to cut out these people, or they eventually cut me out. This excluded me from pretty much every friend group in the department. I never hang out with anyone or get invited to things anymore, which sucks realizing that they only cared because they wanted something physical out of me. All of my other friends live on either coast and I’m an only child with parents old enough to be advisor’s parents lol. I’m effectively friendless day-to-day.

- my only friend in the department is one of those people where you say “can’t live with them, can’t live without them.” If we didn’t work together, I probably wouldn’t put so much effort in. She is toxic and downright mean. She does things like tell me that I’m an overachiever and make everyone in the department look bad because I’m ambitious and driven, even by doing things like joining swim club. I never brag or gloat about grants and fellowships I receive, but she even told me that she automatically hated me when I was accepted because the department announced that I was on a prestigious fellowship. She views the successes of others as her own failures and constantly projects this.

- for solutions, I have done the following: joined marching band for a year to try a new friend group. I’m nearly a decade older and I couldn’t deal with the teen drama as most of them went to HS together.

- joined swim club for the last 2 seasons. It’s ok, not drama but the group is dwindling to 5-10 people and it’s more of an activity rather than friendship thing.

- work out outside of swimming, it helps with mental health and such.

- spoke with CAPS and the ombudsman. CAPS doesn’t really do much for me, they said given the circumstances, I seemed to be positive and doing all I can. I didn’t like the ombuds approach - they told me everyone else had unmet needs and I need to cater to them. I discussed this with my advisor and he agreed we couldn’t do anything about the negativity of my only friend.

- I despise the weather in KS. It has been a harsher winter the past 2 years than it normally is. I’m also very into outdoors stuff and hiking - KS doesn’t cut it for me and I leave every academic break to go somewhere else. It helps, but I dread getting back on the plane and landing here.

- I’ve picked up hobbies like reading (again). 

- I had a rapid onset of allergies to cats and dogs, so I can’t volunteer in the animal shelter anymore. I have a pet lizard and he’s great, but I can’t really get anymore with my travel.

I don’t want to live my life borderline hating everyday, but that’s the point I’m at. I’m even considering driving home and *living with my parents* for part of the summer (I left for college 10 years ago and haven’t been home for more than 3 weeks at a time). I figure if I’m at least near hiking and a better outdoor situation, that could help. Any ideas or suggestions? I don’t want to look back negatively on this part of my life/career that will be a huge defining moment and I want to make the best of it. ",13,8

The moment I stood up my mind when completely blank and I babbled like an idiot for 15 minutes. My mouth went dry, it felt like I was going to die, and I felt like running off the stage. Afterward people I didn't even know came up to console me because it was so obvious I had a panic attack.

Months later I was asked to present another project, and this time the director of the NIH would be present. I should have been honored and excited to present something I'd put months of hard work into, but instead I just felt terrified. ""Just be well prepared and practice more,"" people told me. ""You need to just go back on your SSRI,"" my parents said. I did both and went into the presentation with a positive attitude. The same thing happened and I worried that if I didn't explore other avenues to deal with this problem, it would effect my career for the rest of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to my psychiatrist and we discussed some options. We decided a beta blocker was a bad idea- my resting bp is very low and I'm the type who passes out in a hot shower, so a vasodilator is probably a bad plan. We decided on a low dose benzo. A few days before my presentation I took one to see how I felt, and I didn't feel loopy or sedated at all.

Well yesterday I took one before I presented my research and felt like a totally different person! I still felt some anxiety (these aren't magic pills), but I was able to control it and not let it affect my performance. One of the judges even commented that I seemed very calm and collected.

&amp;#x200B;

Benzodiazepines have a terrible reputation in the world of medicine. I know some psychiatrists (my father included) who won't even prescribe them to their patients with panic disorders for fear they'll become addicted. Should you be taking them every day? Absolutely not- for most people these should be reserved for special situations.

But the bottom line is: if you've exhausted all of the other options and it is severely affecting your life, you should consider talking to your doctor about it. As someone intimately familiar with the healthcare system, I can't emphasize enough how important it is to advocate for yourself and what's best for you career and self confidence.

84,b588uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/b588uo/what_modern_bipartisan_economics_schools_of/,"What modern, bipartisan Economics schools of thought are out there?","Hi r/Academia,

I am hoping to borrow your wisdom on the following two issues my own google research could not find out a satisfactory answer. 

Q1. Is there any online webpage where you can click your specific beliefs (e.g., pro or anti governement spending) to find out where you fall in terms of macroeconomics schools of thought?

Q2. Where would those who self-proclaims as bipartisan or moderate right or left fall in terms of schools of thought?

Background: I am one of those who majored in economics but never learned to the point of how modern/frontier economics are dvided (post-2010). My guess is that probably classical divisions of schools of thought are no longer holding true in academia, but I wonder what schools of thought are there that does a better job of subcategorizing or reflecting different beliefs. Even Mankiw, who seems to be relatively unpopular among the younger generation students, seem to hold diverse views depending on agendas. 

For instance, many people whom I have met held mixed views (e.g., prefer small government but support government regulation on certain issues; sometimes even supporting universal basic income).

How do you know where you fall in terms of the ideological spectrum? Such detailed breakdown and better understanding of schools of thought will be especially helpful in the next upcoming elections, which probably will be full of simplified slogans. Maybe categorization cannot be done, but a terminology similar to ""right-wing Keynesian"" would be still very helpful.",0,1

So I'm in a situation where getting my undergraduate degree online is starting to make a lot of sense. I have a career that saps a lot of my time, and keeps me on the go quite often, making showing up to class a real headache. I'm trying to pursue a degree in mathematics, and take that further to get a Master's and Ph.D down the road. But for now I'm attempting to finish up my undergrad. And that has taken a lot longer than I would've liked, due to my career. So, I'm thinking of transferring to Southern New Hampshire University so I can finish out my degree there, online. I just wanted to get everyones thoughts on how serious an online degree is taken in an academic sense.

  


TL;DR - How seriously would an online undergraduate degree in mathematics be taken in an academic context?",9,1
