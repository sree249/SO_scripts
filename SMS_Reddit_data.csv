11,abu0bs,ed2yn6h,comment,"I can't find any comparisons between WSL and MinGW, only between Linux installed, Linux in a VirtualBox VM, and Linux in Docker for Windows. Linux installed is almost always the fastest - if you have the time and want to take the effort, dual booting is an option. The other three options don't have a clearcut winner in all of the tests.

If you're doing basic C++ programs, I still don't understand why speed is critical. Does it really matter if a compile is half a second slower in WSL if it means overall better support for tools and development? And the tool support is better - MinGW isn't designed to give you an environment for POSIX-compliant application development. If you really want to use Linux development tools, you should take a good look at WSL."
12,abu0bs,ed2yz9r,comment,"What I mean by speed is whether or not the difference between a Linux subsystem and simply the Windows command line is negligible.

13,abu0bs,ed305rb,comment,"WSL by itself won't be a problem. A lot of the slowness in WSL has to do with file IO.

Other than that, I haven't noticed WSL being an issue. Definitely worth checking out in your case."
14,c73z1u,c73z1u,question,"In papers, I often don't know where numbers are coming from. The description is often not formal enough. Even if I'm reading the TeX source. 

This is not true if I'm reading source code. For source code, I can unpeel any definition I want. 

Is there a good way to merge these ideas? To be able to write papers so that for each number shown in a LaTeX document (I guess it'd have to be the latex source) one could see the exact method in which that number was generated, kind of like reading source code?

20,c73z1u,esd7meu,comment,"No, I'm asking if there's a way one might generate something that would allow others to know exactly the way a particular number was generated. 

For example, a paper may say something like: 

> Overall, we found that our model achieved a score of 35.4 as measured by the B baseline...

What I want is a way to have other people know the *exact* computation that lead to 35.4. 

One way I can envision this is having a ""tangled"" TeX document, with TeX code interspersed with code with another programming language, then run some translator on it to generate the actual TeX document that would be published. 

For example, a way I could envision this

    % #+BEGIN_SRC python 
    % ...
    % indiv_scores = bscore(data, target)
    % score = np.mean(indiv_scores)
    % #+END_SRC
    
    Overall, we found that our model achieved a score of \srcvar{score} as
    measured by the B baseline.

Then you would do 

    $ mktex paper.ttx paper.tex
    $ pdflatex paper.tex

The `mktex` command would generate the actual TeX file from the tangled source. Thus, a reader could know exactly how a computation came to be by reading the tangled source and understanding the semantics of `mktex`. 

Here, `\srcvar` would not be an ordinary TeX macro, but rather a directive to `mktex` to perform a replacement. `mktex` would do something like 

1. untangle source blocks
2. execute
3. replace values based on the results of src execution

The question is whether there exists a tool to do something like this. Again, to have the reader be able to know *exactly* where a number in some TeX document came from."
21,c73z1u,esd9qu6,comment,"Oh. Lol yes, this is the sort of thing I was asking for. 

Do you know of anything similar for other programming languages?

Ideally, one wouldn't have to include *all* the code in the TeX file; there would be some sort of importing capability (from files containing most of the heavy duty code). Thus, the paper and the code for it could be presented as one git repo.

BTW, what do you mean by ""bounced""?"
22,c73z1u,esd9u79,comment,"True. This is for a good paper. 

But even so, sometimes its kind of unclear *exactly* how things were carried out. Sometimes, when you try to replicate, you realize that you aren't sure if they mean this or that in a few places, and you're a bit lazy to try it out. What I want is a way so that there absolutely *zero* ambiguity as to where a particular value came from."
23,c73z1u,esd8m00,comment,"considering how much work, and sometimes nontrivial code, with closed source data ... it is not really feasible to put the whole implementation.

You can using the `listings` package (or for prettier code `minted` package) to put a snippet of code in.

However, frankly it is on the author to explain exactly how they got the results they did; describing the method in detail, if it not a common method (which they can name, with minor steps)"

You seem not to know TeX.  Most people who use it are using the LaTeX variant. A person could start with something like this (from memory, not tested).

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{mathtools,amsthm,amssymb}
    \usepackage{sagetex}

    \begin{document}
    There are $\sage{60*60*24*365.25}$ seconds in an average year.
    But no year is average.

25,c73z1u,eserrez,comment,"Tell the reader what you do and why. If you made a choice or decision or assumption, spell it out. Number your equations, describe your process, and make code available either online or in an appendix. For *short* things like a regression model or so, an inline code snippet or a math environment equation will do. All else doesn't belong in the full text.

All of that is solved by the author of the paper and none of that is LaTeX' fault if it's missing. 

Most original research papers intentionally present only the findings and illustrative formulas in the full text, and rather focus on the explanations. It might have taken the authors years to come up with the neat results, numbes, equations and propositions that you see in the text and you certainly don't want a year's worth of term manipulations in the full text, that'd be illegible. And even for a professor it can take a month to fully work through a paper to reproduce the maths - of course you can and maybe should make the derivation available online or in the appendix, but I'll be damned if I want to read through that in the main body."
26,c73z1u,esd9i7t,comment,"Why is it not feasible?

Data files can be specified by a link (in `make`, you could specify that they need to be downloaded into the working directory). Not all data is closed source.

All code will have to be written anyway. No difference whether you enter it in TeX or somewhere else. Pretty sure it's barely any more work, for a lot less of a chance of error (what happens if you miss a digit when copy pasting, etc.)

Also, not all code has to be in the .ttx file above. Source there could import from other files.

Also, some projects do put all their code in a git repo anyway. This is basically including the whole implementation."
27,c73z1u,esebgok,comment,The bounce you are seeing was the OP cross posting it. To get exposure from both communities.
28,c73z1u,esepbb0,comment,"I do know TeX. 

Why can't you import from another file? Not latex usepackage or anything, but put import statements in their code."
29,c73z1u,esfczer,comment,"Why would it appear in the main body. 

I'm saying it would be in the TeX source. When the TeX is compiled, that ridiculous amount of code won't be there.  There's plenty of stuff in the TeX source that isn't present in the PDF."
30,c73z1u,esdabnh,comment,"Well I'm not going to put my 1000s of lines equivalent set of analyses in a TeX like document. Which are usually completely separate from my analysis documents. Especially if I'm working in a large code base that others are also developing. Which is very common in collaborations. 

Some of that code could be closed source. Some open. Some free. If it's open, see if the author has it in a repository somewhere.

The data may or may not be closed, but it could also be so huge it is infeasible to even distribute... Which makes having a document that can't be compiled kinda useless. 

And you don't have to copy and paste... in minted, you can point to a file and line numbers etc, and it will typeset just that.

But really you don't usually want the verbatum code. You want the minimum working example to show the method ignoring validation, error checking, edge cases, internal data structures, etc.

Hell, depending on the language and the layout, seeing how that little bit was calculated would require you to know the full set of all types and classes, and methods.

Not feasible.

It's better by far for the author to explain where the numbers come from, write the expressions in maths, and if it really is needed a simplified implementation in a language of choice, or even pseudo code."
31,c73z1u,esebkph,comment,"Thank you.  I would like to avoid answering such questions.  Is there way, that no doubt I should know, to spot those posts?"
32,c73z1u,eseq1ny,comment,"Yes, certainly.  You can *\input* whatever you like.  There are even ways to bring in only certain lines from files.

Warning for OP: however, a person needs to know LaTeX.  If you have this file

    #!/usr/bin/python3
    print(""Hello World!"")

and you naively bring it in 

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    \input helloworld.py
    \end{document}

then LaTeX is not going to like it.  It will object to the sharp sign, for a starter.  You want to do something more sophisticated than that.   Personally, for listings I use the [*listings*](https://ctan.org/pkg/listings?lang=en) package (although I have to admit my impatience with it is growing).  For executable stuff, myself I use either *SageTeX* as I mentioned above or [*pythontex*](https://ctan.org/pkg/pythontex).

*Edit.*  Sorry, I said ""\include"" when it should say ""\input"".  While I was editing I added the part about LaTeX not liking some things."
33,c73z1u,esecq28,comment,"Well there is a difference between a repost and a crosspost.

A repost is bad to really do, as you can have two parallel discussions and thus wastes twice the time; those are the ones you avoid.

You only know if you are subscribed to all the subreddits it has been reposted to; or you check their history.

crossposts *are* the things you go to; they are just normal posts.
You can tell, for example in /r/LaTeX the post looks like a link post, by the same user, and the ""website hint"" thing that is next to the title will say `self.AskProgramming` rather than the usual for a text post `self.LaTeX`

they may not be crossposted by the same user, however, if some kind redditor sees that another community would have input into it.

You *can* click on the comments of that cross post and comment on the crosspost link ... *this* should be avoided, as it again creates a split discussion.

Clicking on the link, as you would normally, will bring you to the correct text post; with the singular discussion.

So there is an easy way to spot crossposts; it looks like a link post with `(self.OtherSubreddit)` after the title.
You should treat it like it was a text post in `self.ThisSubreddit`, and respond if you know anything.

There is no easy way to see if it's a repost without checking the users history; and if you do, I would agree it would be ok to avoid the whole thing, but if you choose not to, then to pick the one with the most comments, and if few to none, pick the subreddit version that you believe is the most relevant."
34,c73z1u,esfce1z,comment,"Oh no, I was talking about a python import statement in the python code. Obviously the python code will be wrapped in the TeX, similar to the Sage stuff above. All I was trying to say was that not all python code had to be in the TeX file, so it won't get too cluttered. 

Then, the source of the paper can be delivered with the source that generated the numbers in the same repository. The TeX file will have only as much python code as necessary to specify what values it wants dumped in, and most of the computations will be in other files. 

This is the gist of what I'm after. You're given a repository, and you can run make to make literally everything."

58,bftfr2,elg89l2,comment,"Yes, `myArrayPointer[index];` is equivalent to `*(myArrayPointer+index);`

Similarly, for the 2D case: `myArrayPointer[indexOne][indexTwo];` is equivalent to `*(*(myArrayPointer+indexOne)+indexTwo);`.

You can see how it extends for N-dimensional arrays."
59,bftfr2,elgat3z,comment,"For 2d arrays, no. Arrays and pointers are different things.

These are arrays:

    int array[10];
    int matrix[20][30];
    int tensor[40][50][60];

These are pointers:

    int *pointer;
    int **pointer_to_pointer;
    int ***pointer_to_pp;

The thing is that pointer arithmetic is **equivalent** to array indexing. So if you make `pointer` points to the start of an array, then you can start talking about dynamic arrays. And if you have `pointer_to_pointer` point to an array of pointers, then you can start talking about things like dynamic matrices, or an array of stacks, an array of lists, or something else.

To be very specific, a 4x4 matrix of integers is a 2d array that takes `sizeof (int) * 16` bytes of memory:

    int matrix[4][4];

While the following is a single pointer that takes `sizeof (int**)` bytes of memory:

    int **pp;

The difference is particularly meaningful when you are dealing with functions. A function that takes an `int**` will **not** accept an actual matrix. Each structure must be accessed in a different way. Specifically, to acess the element at row `r` and column `c` in a real matrix, you do `matrix[r * width + c]`. And to acess the same position of a pointer-to-pointer which you conveniently treats as a matrix, **then** you do all the pointer derreferencing that ends up giving you the element `*((*p + r) + c)`.

Never forget: arrays and pointers are different thing. You can make a pointer point to an array, and then treat the pointer as an array. But they are different things.

71,cfnsar,cfnsar,question,"Hello,

Recently bought a Windows 10 PC because it was required for my ML-related grad program. I've mostly used Mac for the last 14 years or so, and learned how to program on Macs.

Straight to the question, is it good/common practice to install Linux or Linux virtual machines for programming on PCs? Sorry if this is an amateur question, I'm much less of a software engineer and mostly program for ML/big data purposes.

Reasoning being that I was shocked at how few libraries/programs were accessible or even properly maintained for Windows programming. I've had to use some extreme workarounds just to get basic functionality for many applications, and even then I've had problems with Windows-specific bugs or crashes. I'm also using a pretty popular pre-built laptop.

I'm pretty certain I'm not making any major mistakes; I've done really extensive research and the general sentiment of commenters/bloggers just makes it seem like everything is just way more convenient on Unix.

Would appreciate some advice."

Personally, I use Windows for my desktop because I like a lot of games and the UI of Windows has been getting pretty good recently.

And then I use VirtualBox and Vagrant to manage Linux virtual machines of all kinds, then just SSH in and work from terminal (edit: not entirely from terminal, usually share a project dir with Windows for local editing). Though that software is pretty much going out of fashion now, the cool kids are using Docker Desktop (which is incompatible with VirtualBox and requires restarting if you want to do both).

Also, check out [WSL 2](https://www.howtogeek.com/424886/windows-10s-linux-kernel-is-now-available/), which just came out a month ago if you plan to stick with Windows. The top languages and frameworks on GitHub for ML are platform independent so you should be good either way.

Edit: SSH is also natively supported on Windows, you just have to enable it. Some people haven't discovered that yet and still think you need Putty. Also, it's not at all uncommon to have a Linux VM for development. Linux runs a lot more smoothly as a VM than Windows."
76,cfnsar,eudr4jf,comment,"Honestly it depends on you, I will say I hear a lot of people recommend some sort of Linux OS, but in real life I see most people use either Windows or Mac. A lot of the time it comes down to company acceptability (company may prefer Windows for example so everyone is using the same OS).

Personally though I'm someone who jumps around a lot (Budgie at home, Windows on my portable computer, Mac at work) and they all have their own specific OS bug, specific work arounds etc etc. End of the day though programming is done by people who are quite good at IT, so someones likely built a way for things to work fairly smoothly in all OS. So unless you're trying to do something that works better under a particular OS due to how its made, I personally don't see as huge of a difference."

78,cfnsar,euf7g2b,comment,"Linux blows Mac and Windows out of the water when it comes to programming and not much else.

Whereas Windows and Mac shine for people who want a reliable computer to be productive, play games and/or watch videos or whatever, Linux (GNU) is like the undercover sigma that powers all of it.

Most web servers use Linux and for good reason. Linux is built around a command line, mainly utilizing BASH and a package manager. This makes it really easy to install everything you need, have it be secure and work out of the box with little effort, and gives complete control over the file system. 

My best advice to you is to dual boot Linux on your computer and use it for programming and your main OS for everything else, unless you're absolutely sure Linux can do everything you need. And while using a web server, no doubt about it, use Linux."
79,cfnsar,eubfn1f,comment,That is just BS unless you absolutely want to stick with C libs. And how really wants that anyhow? Nearly all modern languages come with their own package managers which work exactly the same on all platforms.

It only even very recently that Windows isn't a disaster area. And still there's no real consensus about where to put libraries every language and package manager does it different. File permissions and git is a disaster area in Windows.

And yes, the thing I described works best for C/C++. But it's just one example of the tidiness of file org in Linux comparatively. Another would be ""."" directories under your $HOME, or /usr/lib.

These wonderful package managers you're espousing have some pretty bad flaws not the least of which is very little review of what's in them.

Edit: and a **major** advantage of using VMs is that I don't dirty up my desktop with a hundred languages, package managers, apache, databases, etc."
83,cfnsar,eucy7xb,comment,"I run Proxmox on an old Laptop of mine as a ""Server"". Works really well: You setup a Linux VM and then mount it as a drive over the network into Windows (SMB). Open that folder in your IDE of choice and you can directly modify project files inside the VM. Then you can SSH into the VM to control the rest (I use the Windoes Subsystem for Linux for SSH etc)."

85,cfnsar,eufaote,comment,"Yeah I don't like Windows 10 either. Its layout is cluttered. Windows in general handles software installs with compiled .exe files, which becomes a pain when using apps as dependencies, tweaking software and installing multiple things at once. That's why I don't use it for programming, it turns into a nightmare when writing software.

For your use case, I recommend you dual boot MacOS and Linux. Use MacOS for all your basic productivity and entertainment, and use Linux for programming. To do this, you'll have to learn about disk partitioning, something that's a YouTube search away. As for a good Linux distro, you can use whatever but I use Ubuntu because it's stable and most Linux software is available for it."
86,bdm3z4,bdm3z4,question,"Hello all,

I have been learning web development over the past few years and have progressed significantly. Right now I am learning React. However, in my studies I run across a recurring problem: I see something in some code, and it is unexplained. The problem I'm running into right now is very specific, but can be generalized pretty easily. For example, this syntax from the styled components documentation:

    const Button = styled.button`
      /* Adapt the colors based on primary prop */
      background: ${props =&gt; props.primary ? ""palevioletred"" : ""white""};
      color: ${props =&gt; props.primary ? ""white"" : ""palevioletred""};

      font-size: 1em;
      margin: 1em;
      padding: 0.25em 1em;
      border: 2px solid palevioletred;
      border-radius: 3px;
    `;

My Javascript is not great, I am learning it but it will be a while before I know it all. Here I don't understand what the ` is doing. Presumably that's some kind of base Javascript functionality, but I don't understand what it does?

Is there somewhere where I can input code and have it highlight what the syntax is? For example, in Python if I input something that contained ""Foo.attribute"" it would link me to using the attributes of an object.

It seems like it would be pretty straight forward to build seeing as how interpreters already know what all the syntax means.

Does this exist? If not, maybe I'll build it!"
87,bdm3z4,ekz6j5h,comment,"as to what the `s indicate: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals

i'm not aware of any type of learning utility like that. it'd be pretty neat but generally not that useful once you gain a bit of experience. most languages implement these concepts in some way so you get pretty good at figuring out what's going on even if you've never seen the specific syntax before."
88,bdm3z4,ekziyx8,comment,"That's an ECMA string interpolation technique.

Consider this in JavaScript:

    var name = ""Jane"";

Now consider the version with interpolation:

    const name: string = ""Jane"";

    const surname: string = ""Doe"";

    const interpolated: string = `Hi, my name is ${name} ${surname}`;

They're called backticks as previously mentioned, and the technique is also called template strings. Here's more info for a deeper dive.

89,bdm3z4,ekz7hwa,comment,"The thing is the amount of syntax in any given language is rather limited. A tool which explains syntax only has a very narrow target audience and even that audience might be annoyed by all the explainations of syntax they already know.

`Foo.property` on the other hand is semantics. There is an infinite amount of semantics that can be expressed in any language, hence tools stay useful even for experienced users."
90,bdm3z4,ekz9r4b,comment,"\` means ""template literal"", as mentioned by /u/anamorphism, which generally makes it easier to write strings with newlines and throw variable values wherever without using a lot of string concatenations. A less-used feature is like what you see here, where you can define a function that will use the literal in some way, changing the rules of what is put in it. I don't know what `styled.button` does, it should be defined elsewhere in the code. `String.raw\` blah \`` is the simplest example of a ""template tag"".

121,cnzt8t,ewgesm1,comment,"Senior Developer here. 

The biggest issue I've experienced with other developers through my time moving up is the extreme lack of empathy and community focus. 

Most developers are into building their own little code empire and want minimal input from others, their way is THE RIGHT way, and go figure it out for yourself 90% of the time. Their job is to go to work do their shit and go home, who needs co workers? 

This attitude is pervasive I know a Directory/VP of technology at Delivery.com  and his exact words were ""interpersonal skills are worthless"" this shitty culture is why devs get such a bad rap. 

While I spend a considerable amount of time training the junior devs, i see it as an investment into making less work for myself to do. 
The one thing I can tell you is **spend time teaching yourself early in your carreer** 40 hours for work and 20 hours a week for your own professional development. You dont need to do it for a long time but 6 months of that and you'll be up to speed as the sr devs."

123,cnzt8t,ewfzk0y,comment,"Appreciated, Relieving just as the other comments say. TY! :)

But ->

Sometimes, when searching on job searching sites such as indeed, linkedin etc. some job titles do not seem to match the ""required"" skills while other job posts look reasonable(?). e.g. junior java developer but under the description says 2-3 years of experience ""required"". 

I would understand if it was under preferred or something but ""required"". I don't know if the employers make mistakes when writing the job post or is lazy(?) or is trying to lure 'naive and fresh meat', but if you have 2-3 years of experience then I don't feel like you are really a junior/entry developer. XD

Maybe ""experience"" and ""reasonable"" is subjective or means a bit different to the employers? Or they really want a competent employee? 'm still new so I wouldn't know any better but what the job searching sites say and want. XD

Regardless of how good a junior developer may be, I would think that analytical and problem solving skills and being able to learn something new and use that new knowledge/skill would be important. Of course i'm not including soft-skills and the given and such for simplicity sake. E.g. You are proficient in python but maybe you'll have to learn about some more in-depth of the back-end or servers or AI or some new framework or library to expand your knowledge and thus being able to come up with more solutions?

144,bwdl7b,epxcyap,comment,"My understanding is that the terminal receives KeySyms from your window manager, and decides how to encode these so that they can be sent over a pipe (STDIN) to your foreground process. For ctr + key, it encodes it as `^` + `capitalized letter or normal symbol` (this is why programs like vim can't distinguish between ctrl-a and ctrl-A for example). For the `alt` modifier, I believe it prepends with a `^[`, but preserves case.

However, `^C`, `^Z`, and some other special keys are captured by the terminal, and do specific actions. `^C` sends a `SIGINT` signal to the foreground process, `^Z` puts the foreground process in the background. I suspect that it is possible to tell your terminal to not capture these keys, and instead just encode them and send them to the process, but I'm not finding an easy way to do this for just the `^C` key.

I do know however that you can set your terminal driver from cooked/canonical to raw/non-canonical mode, which can disable all of special character processing and line manipulation. This is what editors like vim operate in, and might be why it can receive all special keys (besides some alt-modified keys) without the terminal intercepting them."

161,cy1f5u,eyp580h,comment,"Do you mean ""programming languages"" instead of ""programs""?

If so, HTML is not a programming language, it's a markup language. CSS isn't a programming language either. 

JavaScript is, and it's used everywhere on the Web, so it may be a source of good income. Python is also used almost everywhere, not only on the Web, from deep learning to front end development. It's one of the most popular languages in the world, used by lots of companies. Java is run by lots of businesses, and Java programmers are paid well.

I would go with Python because it's easy to learn, gives you lots of opportunities and a high development speed (so that you'd spend the majority of time actually doing stuff, not trying to understand Python's technical intricacies)."
162,cy1f5u,eypryl2,comment,"First of all, HTML and CSS are not programming languages. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. These two combine to make most of what you see on a webpage. HTML tells your browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.)  what types of things should be made, and CSS tells your browser how they should look. JS, which is short for JavaScript, is in fact a programming language. In terms of web development, it is most commonly used to tell your browser how to things that HTML and CSS made should work. In other words, things like upvoting this post is a JavaScript function that communicates your click to a reddit server to say ""this post received another upvote!"" It then adds a number to the counter, and stores that number on the server to be accessed by the next person who loads this webpage so they can see the correct number of upvotes the post has.

Like others have said programming is not a means to an end. Anybody can be a programmer, but not everyone who's a programmer will be able to get a job. I read that you are welder;  if I pick up a torch and weld two pieces of metal together, then I could say I am a welder... But no one is gonna hire me because I have no idea how to actually make that skill worth anything. I wouldn't know any of the specifics like which metals to use for a certain job, or how to correctly make a weld. The same thing goes for programming. You can write all the code you want, but if you don't how to write the correct code, then what is it worth?

That's not to say you can't do it. In fact I want to lead you in the opposite direction. I believe anyone can do what ever they put their mind to as long as they have the determination to get there.

The first choice you have to make is ""What kind of problems do I want to solve?"" You've already made part of this choice by choosing to get into programming. Programming is all about solving problems involving computers in a methodical way, however there a lot of problems out there, and not all problems can be solved with the same language. Do you want to solve problems involving websites such as how the data is transferred, or how the user interacts with the website? Maybe you'd like to solve problems involving video games like how the character interacts with its environment? Perhaps you'd like to solve problems involving a programming language itself, and how it interacts with the computer? Think about this, do some research, and figure out what would be most satisfying for you. But understand it is a long journey before you can get to the point where you are actually capable of solving those problems.

Once you know what type of problem you want to solve, you can choose the best language to get you started on that path. Another thing to keep in in mind is most problems will require you to be capable of leveraging multiple different languages at once. Programmers don't learn just one language and call it a day. New technologies are evolving everyday and new programming languages to come with them. Knowing only one language would be like only being able to weld one type of metal. It might get your foot in the door, but you won't get far without know other skills. Another analogy would be that programming languages are like the tools in your toolbox. You might have a screwdriver, a hammer, and a saw. If you need a piece of wood to become two pieces of wood, you could scrape away at it with the screw driver for years, or you could hammer one side off a ledge and split it. The best choice however would be to grab your saw, and cut it where it needs to be cut. The saw is a great tool for this, but it won't get you very far when you need to connect those two pieces of wood, that's why you have a screwdriver! (And hopefully a drill and screws.)

Once you decide on the language you want to start with, you can search the internet for tutorials or even read the official documentation of that language. When you are learning your first language it is important that you don't dwell too much on the words and symbols that you are typing. What you should focus on is why you are typing those words, and what they instruct the computer to do. This is the common theme between all programming languages. Different languages will implement the same capabilities in different ways. (Different languages will also have their own unique capabilities for solving unique problems!) The key is knowing how to combine those capabilities into something that is useful. For example I could say: 

    IF I know a thing is TRUE, THEN I can 
        DO something 
    OTHERWISE I will 
        DO a different thing.

Almost every language has this capability to some extent, but the way it is implemented will vary from language to language. What is important is understanding the logic behind this capability and in what situation you would need to use it. 

All that being said, I know it's probably a lot to chew at once, so I can point you in a specific direction if you so desire. If you want to do things the super hard way you should start with C. It will be super hard, but ultimately you will learn a lot. Alternatively if you want to do things the regular hard way, you can start with C's son: C++. It will still be hard, but not as hard as C. I think the most common language people learn first (at least in school) is Java. It is a bit easier for people to understand what significance the words they're typing have. Many people recommend Python as a first language, which is not a bad choice either. Ultimately it comes back to what problems you want to solve. All four of those languages can more or less solve the same problems but in different ways. Each one however will have its advantages and disadvantages in comparison to the others, and each one will have its unique capabilities for solving unique problems.

The most important piece of advice I can give you: don't give up when things get confusing. There is a saying: ""pain is weakness leaving the body"" I could say the same thing about confusion but maybe in a bit harsher way: ""confusion is stupidity leaving the brain"". As a programmer you are going to be confused every single day, but that just means you are getting smarter every single day! :)

Good luck!"

The reason why many people tell you to start off with languages like Java or Python is that once you understand how coding works in those languages, you can easily pick up other languages (like HTML or CSS you mentioned). You haven't touched HTML/CSS yet, so you don't know if you're going to like it or not.

If you are really interested in web development, start off right way with HTML/CSS."

I sort of can map out the structure at the surface level. But as I get deeper I get really lost because it seems like (my explanation might be wrong) it's multiple systems intertwined.

If you're on windows, my favorite git client is https://desktop.github.com/ -- As a bonus it comes with `git-bash` which gives you linux command line programs on windows. 

If you're new to git, there's interactive tutorials. Search for ""interactive git tuts"". Learning some of git on the command line helps to understand what git does. 

**beware of official git documentation**. Docs at https://git-scm.com/docs/ go **way** too deep for what you need. This is a case where blog tutorials are actually better. 

https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials has a good mix of medium detail, it walks you through steps, but you can also use it as a reference.

Important to understand:

- how to create a new branch / what that means.
- how switching branches actually swaps out local  files.
- merging branches / pull requests. 

The GUI above makes things like creating/merging branches easier. It also lets you choose which files to commit, or uncheck those you don't want to. Or switch between the diffs on different files. Or to revert changes on a file to the last commit. Or even revert all files. These takes longer to do using the commandline. 

I'm not surprised, that's a lot of techs to be combined even if you know them. 

> But between deadlines and self learning. It's taxing.

Yep. Taking breaks are important. If you worked all day programming, you might want to do something ""simple"" to recharge yourself. 

I don't think you've mentioned this, but I feel it's important. Don't worry about ""perfect"" code. Someone may have a clever 1-liner trick to solve a problem, and uses less variables. You have to decide if saving 2 lines of code is worth making it harder to understand when you come back to it 4 months later. IDE's have hotkeys to quickly jump to other files or functions. Code is read more often than written. 

#  Tips for working on complicated systems.

1. Do you know how to use a debugger? If not, learn it. It will save you so much time. Some languages like python give you a lot to  work with in a debugger.

For example: You're making a reddit app using Python's module `PRAW`

With a debugger you can create a breakpoint before a command fails.

2. I've found creating ""integration tests"" help to understand the system. Web apps tend to have ""integration tests"" which are a bit more than a ""regular unit test"". One test might need to 

    1. make a user login 
    2. write to a SQL table
    3. end

First check for tests that already exist in the system. One test might show how you connect to a Database. Another shows how to write one item to a DB table. 

Otherwise start with basics. Write a test to (ex: create a DB connection). Then you can focus on smaller pieces. Trying to understand 5 libraries at once is hard.

Uh. Like I said above we are only able to access the files through ssh through git bash and I'm not sure if we can use debuggers . I'm sorry if I can't explain the stack well. But what I do though is add logging and tail the log files.

From what I understand the project is deployed and working and we just make changes from the inside.

What I tried to do is created my own DB connection because I couldn't find the object that makes changes to the db. Not best practice I think.

> Even though the code will feel like a workaround? How about best practice, is it ok not to follow it all the time? I'm not versed in best practices but sometime the things I do felt wrong because of it.

You do want to follow best-practices. I meant more like don't pre-optimize code in a way that makes it harder to understand, unless you've profiled and know you need to. If that makes sense. 

You can automate some of those by using code formatters, and linters. You can get them in a lot of languages these days. 

For Python formatters, my current favorite is black. The default settings are good. The other ones you might need to configure them a bit.  Formatters will automate things like:
- splitting a string up into 2 if it's too long
- making sure you have the same whitespace between functions
- etc


https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_formatting


Linters will warn you about problems not related to formatting. Stuff like:

204,bsj9r7,bsj9r7,question,"Hello,

I'm working with a legacy job processing system, in which each task has a concept of smaller steps. This is a multi process system, where steps of a particular task might or might not be executed on the same worker ( all communication is done through Redis ). Imagine the following task , CreateUser, with the following steps:

&amp;#x200B;

\- verify\_registration\_data

\- import\_existing\_data

\- normalize\_imported\_data

\- send\_onboarding\_email

&amp;#x200B;

Those tasks will be executed sequentially, starting with the verify\_registration\_data one, however, in some of the existing tasks, based on some condition, you could jump a few steps. The pattern employed throughout the system is that usually 

the current step of the job will queue execution of the next step, with some arguments, so you could think of it like the output of a specific step in the job plan, becomes the input of the next step.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine that for example step2 might download some data ( let's say a JSON file ) , and add some ""metadata"" fields, and it would need to pass it to the next step in the task. Because job steps might not be executed on the same worker, we usually upload the files to S3, and then the next step in the list will receive a URL which it would need to download. This pattern repeats in many jobs, and it adds up to quite a lot of time spent upload/downloading files.

&amp;#x200B;

I was toying with the idea of perhaps adding some kind of intermediate service and have all uploads/downloads pass through it, and have it running on each of the worker machine, and whenever I upload/download something through this 3rd service, broadcast a message so that all ""cache services"" would grab a copy, which they would keep in RAM, in order to be able to serve it faster. This, however will open up the door to possible race conditions and possibly difficult  cache invalidations. I thought also about saving those files in redis, but it would fill up redis really quick.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you guys been in a similar situation? If yes, how did you handle it?

Thanks!"
205,bsj9r7,eonudyi,comment,"Can’t the workers themselves supply the file? If they can you cut your IO time in half as there is no upload. For eg: worker finishes job, instead of uploading, the worker simply opens an end point for the next process to get the data."
206,bsj9r7,eonun7h,comment,"Could you detail this a bit? The workers are not web apps, and even if they would be, since they're not executing on the same machine, wouldn't this introduce latency again, as a worker from machine A might need to do a request to a worker from machine B?"
207,bsj9r7,eonwunk,comment,"As how you were thinking about a caching service, when a machine finishes a step, it doesn’t need to upload the file to any server at all. It can simply keep the copy with itself and say mark the file with an id. And send this id along with the machine’s address/port to the que. the next worker can see this address/port and file id and request the same from the first machine. This way you are only downloading the file and never uploading the files to another server. This works if you have control over the machines. And all you’ll need is a file/data server on your worker machines. So that other machines can request the files that they need (through the details they get in the queue)

Other than that, caching or loading the file into ram of a third party server wouldn’t give you much advantage. Because your bottleneck is not how fast can the file be loaded into memory. Your bottle neck is the to and fro trips to the caching server that the file needs to go from machine A to caching server to machine B.

Also:
If machine A knows beforehand that machine B will execute the next step, then you might as well let machine B have a mechanism to receive the file locally/in-memory and use the file when it is ready. This way you are only uploading the file always and never downloading it. Again cuts your time in half."
208,bsj9r7,eonxbhl,comment,"Interesting. I don't know ahead of time which machine will execute the next request. When one step is finished, a message gets pushed back into redis, and whichever worker manages to pop it first, will be the one executing. About the caching mechanism, I was thinking more of having each worker maching run a small(ish) in memory cache which would be notified whenever new files are uploaded, so that it would know to grab recently uploaded files. Not really sure whether this would be a good solution, as we ocasionally have bursts of tasks that we need to process, and I think RAM might get filled up really fast by these other services."
209,bsj9r7,eonyjnf,comment,"Any opinions on using EFS ( [https://aws.amazon.com/efs/](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) ) , or mounting the bucket via FUSE?"
210,bsj9r7,eonz0l1,comment,"Yea each machine having a copy of all files gets you the speed you need. But then again if all of the files from all the machines will fit in the memory or not of each machine, you’d need to check your business requirements. If this doesn’t work, your safest bet would be to keep local copies of the files at each machine that other machines can pull when needed. If that doesn’t also work (because you have huge data from each machine that builds up fast) then s3 is the way to go.



Btw, if you want to make your solution work and struggling to fit all files into memory, How about you extend your idea and do round robin caching? You have 10 machines, and each machine stores and executes only files that are file_number % machine_number == 0. That way each machine stores only 1/10th of the total cache store. I’m simplifying it, but you get the idea, if you have three machines that do specific step, then they store and process 1/3rd data each. Could work if you need a clever way to fit the data :)"
211,bsj9r7,eonz83a,comment,Are your systems already in aws network? Or will you be bound by your internet speed?
212,bsj9r7,eoo09mp,comment,"This sounds really clever, but wouldn't this pose some problems if the number of worker machines is scaled up/down?"
213,bsj9r7,eonzhu2,comment,"Yes, everything is in AWS."
214,bsj9r7,eoo153v,comment,"If you want to scale down, mark unprocessed files from the respective machines and add them to the distributer queue before nuking out the machines. If you want to scale up, increment your machine count and new machines will start working easily."
215,clwmhp,clwmhp,question,"Hey all,

Currently in the financial world and looking to get out. It has become a toxic work environment and I feel like I'm not gaining any new skills. To advance, I'd have to go into sales roles, which do not interest me. I was thinking of signing up at a Technical College near my house in their Software Development program to learn some new skills. The only experience I have was coding websites back in the early 2000's in HTML. My main concern is I have 2 colleagues who felt the same way about our job who quit, went to coding bootcamp, and a year later returned (with a whole bunch of debt) to the same job because they couldn't find anything in the Dev world. What I like about this tech college is they offer 2 externships with local companies along with job placement after graduation (82% success rate). These are two advantages I see over the bootcamps my colleagues did. In addition to that, it costs about 1/4 the price. It does take about 12 months, however, where their bootcamps lasted 6 months. I don't mind the extra time commitment, I feel like that will just give me more time to really learn the material. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my main question/concern is the course list. I'm not sure if the classes will give me relevant knowledge to be able to find a job after I'm done so I'm hoping someone can give an opinion on them. I honestly don't know what kind of jobs to be looking for once is all said and done, but I'm just looking to expand my resume a bit to create some opportunities. The course list is as follows:  **Introduction to Software Development,**  **HTML/CSS Basics,**  **Programming Basics,**  **SQL Fundamentals,**  **Linux Essentials,**  **Version Control Fundamentals,**  **Unit Testing,**  **JavaScript,**  **Java Programming I,**  **Java Programming II,**  **C++ Programming I,**  **C++ Programming II,**  **C# Programming I,**  **C# Programming II,**  **Database Development Fundamentals,**  **Web API Basics,**  **ASP.NET Applications,**  **PHP and MySQL,**  **Mobile Development: Android,**  **Mobile Development: iOS,**  **Software Development Externship,**  **Special Project I,**  **Special Project II,**  **Special Project III,**  **Math for Information Technology,**  **Microsoft Network Fundamentals** 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I should also mention I'm about to turn 34 but still feel like I'm 21. Not sure if that makes a difference but I guess it's a concern when I know there will be tons of CS graduates out there competing for the same jobs who'll have an advantage over me. My bachelor's is in finance and I've basically just done financial services roles since I graduated. Based on that background, is there any type of work out there where I can leverage this experience and combine them with the skills I'll pick up in school? 

Feel like this post is all over the place but can clear up anything with some editing.

Thanks for hearing me out and for any advice you can give."
216,clwmhp,evyd3eh,comment,"I don't have any experience in job switching or college vs bootcamp. 

However the first thing that comes to mind when reading that course list is: Wow, that is a lot. I hope you are ment to pick and choose courses otherwise you will be left with a whole lot of nothing after 12 months.

For example it makes no sense to learn Microsoft Network Fundamentals, iOS development and Java in the same 12 months if your goal is to get a job by the end of it. If you can pick and choose the right combinations i'm sure you can get something out of it.

You have great domain knowledge in finance that will certainly be helpful if you manage to find a job within that field. You could be a web developer for a banking company for example. You might want to look into job opportunities in your area before you choose what to do.

edit: spelling is hard"

If it were that easy, everyone would have a dev job. The competition for jobs is very fierce and employers tend to be picky about who they hire (and rightfully so)."
218,clwmhp,evygqeq,comment,This is a good question for r/cscareerquestions
219,clwmhp,evyqsng,comment,"Keep working your job. See if there are any programming skills you could apply to it, like automating things with selenium, writing excel scripts, making a mockup front end application that requests info from a database(JS -React(styled modules)/Express/GraphQL).  Implement some logic in there as well. Make something cool. 

Start looking around for jobs that you want. Look at the requirements.

Start learning those required skills in your free time, or even on the job.

All of those skills listed in that course, you could learn for free online. You wouldn’t master any of those skills in the class anyways, it simply takes time and practice, class or self learned. 

Apply to some jobs way before you’re ready. Some will even let you train yourself in and give you a roadmap similar to what a class or boot camp could offer. 

No debt, free skills gained, skills that you learn are DIRECTLY applicable to your new domain. 


Just a suggestion. 

Good luck."
220,clwmhp,evyoajl,comment,"That is a massive course load, I’m having a hard time imagining all that in one year.

If you were already a self taught proficient programmer,  maybe that course load is feasible.  If you can figure out programming intuitively,  going through that course would probably just help you in the interview process, because you increase the odds you know a little about the employer’s preferred technology"
221,clwmhp,evywjoo,comment,"The first thing I would say is have you looked for other jobs in your field? As soon as it starts getting shit get looking for jobs. Loyalty unfortunately doesn't get you much these days. I would also advise learning while still working. It'll take longer but the risk is so much smaller. It is not easy, if it was everyone would do it. If you want to put yourself ahead get a GitHub account and start posting projects. CVs give a good indication of experience but tell you nothing about actual coding skill. I would much rather see some actual projects rather than a big list of qualifications."
222,clwmhp,evyx3iy,comment,"I'm torn on the school & course list.

First let me start with this.  I have an uncle who wanted to change careers into IT.  He took a bunch of classes, spent a bunch of money, also got several technology certifications and never got an IT job.  He tried, but no one wanted to hire him for IT.  I'm guessing I'd they wanted to hire someone new to the field they probably also wanted them young (fresh out of college in their 20s).  

No matter what you do, there is going to be some element of that you'll have to deal with.

Now, back to learning.  Programming is hard.  It's really, really hard.  After only 1 year you're going to be terrible at it.  It takes at least 3+ years of 40 hour programming weeks to reach the level of just sucking at it.  To get okay is 5 to 7 years.  Takes probably 10 to actually be good at it.  Those are approximate MINIMUMS for everyone, no exceptions.  Did I mention that programming is hard?

So, are you SURE you want this?  If you are just looking for a good alternative career go health care instead.  They have excellent training schools that you will be absolutely qualified to get a job after completing.  Health Care is much easier to get into or switch into.

If you are hell bent on programming youre going to need school, dedication and time.  The reason they have so many courses at that school is to give you exposure.  You are going to be terrible at all of it, but see above everyone is terrible fresh out of school.  The idea of all those classes is you can apply to 90% of jobs and honestly say yes you have worked in that language. Which is not a terrible idea.

But I wouldn't expect to just walk out of that school with a job.  Plan to spend additional passing some certification exams also.  And expect that it might take you 6 months just to land an entry level job.

Oh, and remember, you are starting over.  You are going to get paid minimum with little vacation and poor benefits as a programmer because you are starting at the bottom."
223,clwmhp,evyxdpa,comment,"As another user suggested maybe r/cscareerquestions would be better for your situation. I’m about to start my first year of software dev in college soon and just by comparing the two programs, please maybe rethink your options. All those courses in a span of 12 months? That seems like a lot to cram in such little time. Try looking into some more colleges and their programs, you might need to spend another year studying if you really want to get much out of it. I’d suggest a good boot camp, but most boot camps I’ve seen weren’t really for software dev, more for web dev or data science. Wish I could help more, but that’s my two cents."
224,clwmhp,evz1sgy,comment,"Software development is hard job, which requires years and years of learning and very good motivation. 

Try first some cheap but good online course and self-learning. If you have motivation to really go deep and create some simple own application, then plan how to continue."
225,clwmhp,evyhbwh,comment,"+1 for this, I'd say check out what jobs are in demand in your area and look for boot camp with more focus. No need for so many languages at all. Java and C# I'd consider essentially the same anyway, in terms of Learning. And a year is nowhere near enough for all those languages. Do java or C# and networking, database, etc."
226,clwmhp,evyj96y,comment,"Thanks for this. Sadly I'm not able to pick and choose from these, it's the required coursework for graduating. I will look into web developer jobs in my area and see what the requirements are."
227,clwmhp,evyjaij,comment,Much appreciated. Did not know that sorta subreddit existed.
228,clwmhp,evzh9wc,comment,"This is the cold hard truth. I was hoping to quit my job and go full-on coding, but that would be very unwise at this point. I need to suck it up and do both work and this on the side until I can transition completely after finding a job. 

We actually have been expanding our cyber security and software dev group at my firm recently. I should probably go network a bit with them, find out what they are looking for, and focus on those skills there instead. It would probably be easier to find a job within the organization as opposed to outside. 

Thanks"
229,clwmhp,evzh26d,comment,"I am definitely not proficient in this stuff. I would basically be starting from scratch, aside from basic HTML. Might be in over my head from what it sounds like."
230,clwmhp,evzhfks,comment,"Yes, I have looked at other jobs. Thing is, I'm pretty much stuck in this ""Customer Service"" role in finance. If I want to move up, I'd have to go into Sales or Management, neither of which really interest me tbh. You're right though. I've been so angry at my job, I've been to just want to walk out and go to school full time. But I know that wouldn't be wise. Where is a good place to get started if I wanted to do this on the side after work?"
231,clwmhp,evyl7w8,comment,"Then no, do not take this course. 

Why on earth would anyone try to cram 6-8 **different** languages into a 12 month course? You would only scratch the surface of so many things without being able to do anything in any of them... For perspective the Software Engineering bachelor first year courses (12 months) at my university looks like:

- Introduction to programming
- Computer Architecture and Operating Systems
- Mathematics 1
- Databases with Intermediate Programming
- Software Engineering 1 with Database Project

with the only language used being Java."
232,clwmhp,ewbmt1f,comment,"To add to what the others have said, in the span of 4 years, I have learned the very basics of:

Python, C#, Java, C++, and the absolute minimum assembly. Nothing else.

Another 3 years later, I can only claim to be competent in Java and nothing else.

6 languages in 12 months means you won't learn anything. Others keep suggesting ""it will be tough"", no, it's impossible. You will remain with nothing out of it, waste of time IMHO."
233,clwmhp,evzm1s8,comment,"For cyber security you could look into the OSCP certification. You could apply this security knowledge to pentesting the company webapp and their local network. I would recommend this program, it helped me understand secure coding practices as well. 

But if you don’t care about security or you are willing to do both security and development (some do), you should see if your company has any blockchain development projects they are thinking of doing. I feel like that is a big focus for a lot of financial firms. You could then learn substrate or ethereum smart contract development, and learn how to render that data to the GUI w react. Would probably get you a nice raise as well haha"
234,clwmhp,evzgzl7,comment,"Yeah, good points. I have no idea why they try to cram all of those in. To be honest, I really only considered this because of the 2 internships they offer + job placement of 82%. Now it seems like I might be second guessing it."
235,clwmhp,evzjbtk,comment,"Their contacts and internships are without a doubt valuable, but at what cost. At least talk to an advisor / professor about the course if you want to enrol.

Otherwise as others have mentioned you could always pursue this on your free time, for free! Here are a few resources to get started:

- [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) with Python (the author also has an [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/automate/)). Aimed at beginners and quickly gets you into doing practical exercises. 

- University of Helsinki has [Java MOOC](https://mooc.fi/en/) courses. These will be at very least be equal (if not better) to the Java courses you mentioned. Very good structure.

Both of these will get you to a point where you can build things on your own and easily expand on that knowledge."
