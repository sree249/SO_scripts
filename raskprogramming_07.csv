6,cikg2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/cikg2a/is_there_a_name_for_this_design_goal/,Is there a name for this design goal?,"In computer engineering, there's the famous goal of ""scalability"". But that's mostly for performance; it refers to a system's ability to accommodate a higher workload with linear scaling of costs. 

Is there a name for the design goal of scalability, but from the programmer's perspective (sort of)? Basically, the goal of designing the skeleton of a system such that when a programmer works on any given part, they don't have to think about the bigger picture and how *everything* connects together, and they can focus all their energy on their little portion. 

I'm familiar with the design goal of modularity, but I think I'm speaking of something slightly different. There are systems that satisfy my property, but I wouldn't describe as ""modular"", necessarily. Some examples:

- Academic papers. Academics don't need to think about how their work fits into the bigger picture of human knowledge. They can just submit their paper to the correct journals, and their paper will get incorporated into the proper place within our collective knowledge automatically. 
- Wikipedia. Volunteers don't have to think about how their edits will impact the entirety of Wikipedia, despite the fact that at any one point in time, ""Wikipedia"" is just some set of articles, and they are changing that state. They don't need to think about policy guidelines or whatever---as long as they're editing with good intentions, everything will self correct. 

The idea I'm trying to capture here is a system that has a lot of entities working on it together, but is carefully designed so that the workers can focus as much energy as possible on their work, and not how the system fits together, for the system to be successful. 

This is obviously more general than programming, but I'm asking it here because I tend to get the best answers from here. 

It's not modularity, because that's more a property of what the system looks like (it has modules) than what it's able to do. It's not ""self correcting"", because that doesn't capture the notion of making the collective effort sum together in an efficient way. Maybe ""efficient""? But that means many things. 

Sorry for the long post. Also, reading this again I realize this perhaps isn't the most clear, so please ask me for clarifications as to what I'm trying to say.",8,6,2019-07-27 13:40:48

Hopefully the link above works. Please let me know if that's not the case.

I'm moving from C to C++, writing a simple chess engine as a first project, in XCode. Running into a bug I've got no idea how to fix. I consider myself a good C programmer and I have a good handle on stack frames and where most data lives in memory in a C program, however I have very little understanding of all the various constructors that C++ offers or how &amp; when they allocate memory.

I have a breakpoint on the constructor in the second image, set to the condition that (r &lt; 0 || r &gt; 7 || c &lt; 0 || c &gt; 7), since the oob (out of bounds) member seems to be getting set incorrectly. I hit the breakpoint, and the debugger showed both r and c as having the value 0 but being greater than 7. I added a new expression ""r"" to the variable view window and this time it showed up as a large (seemingly random?) value. Using ""view memory"" on either of the ""r"" expressions in that window shows me the same pointer to the same chunk of memory.

The nonzero value of r has no zeroed bytes so it doesn't seem to be an endian or word-size issue. My best guess is it's some complication of C++'s member initialization that I don't understand.

One example case is for embedding training. An embedding would be 256 dimensions of float32 values, and there would be say 60 million of those embeddings. 

I think I can just use a single column in all cases, but there may be some instances where multiple columns would be helpful. For example, each column would represent a different component in the machine learning architecture.

Each update step in the training would be looking up and writing values do the data store, so I am looking for the fastest database for my situation. Having a database at all would already significantly reduce ram memory, so that that is not a concern for me.",6,3,2019-07-27 19:26:42

(Tried it but run into a bunch of errors with &lt;, ++, and \*. Also tried a.compareTo(b) == 0, i.add(ONE), and multiply(), but not surprisingly still ran into errors. I'm really not sure what the best way to run a for loop with BigIntegers is.)

1. Iterate through each row and compare it against every other row
2. Score each comparison based on the set criteria of the personality test  (e.g. the users share one or more types of humor in common) 
3. Create a new sheet and log the matches and scores for each user (see example below).

AnimalBaseClass has a method called SetCurrentBehaviour with a type parameter.

I would want to have a AnimalBehaviourBaseClass that has methods that all behaviours have in common. This is inherited by both ReptileBehaviour and MammalBehaviour classes.

The classes inheriting from AnimalBaseClass should only be able to set behaviours of its animal class. So Crocodile and snake can only accept ReptileBehaviour and classes derived from it. And Apes and Felines can only accept MammalBehaviour and classes deriving from it.

But the actual SetCurrentBehaviour method is the same for all animals. Is it somehow possibly to through polymorphism change the type requirement so that this is enforced? In the AnimalBaseClass it should the SetCurrentBehaviour

in Reptile it should be SetCurrentBehaviour and in Mammals SetCurrentBehaviour

Of cours i could add methods to Reptile and Mammal classes but then the original SetCurrentBehaviour från AnimalBaseClass would still be there.

Hey all.

I am a supervisor of a rather large company. We require scheduling all individuals into their respective places otherwise it could lead to shortages.

I want to make a user management program, or an automated scheduler. The goal of the project is to track where a user is in their training.

**Example**

1. User 1 can make pencils
2. User 2 can make pencils, and pens
3. User 3 can make pencil, pens, and can assemble staplers.
4. User 4 is a trainer, but can also do all of the above.
5. User 5 is a team lead, trainer, and can do all of the above.

The programs job would be to organize the users and place them in the best possible spot with a goal of everything being covered, but also maximizing training. For example, if the program sees an opportunity to train a User 1 to a User 2 it could assign a User 4 to be with the User 1.

What I need is a good programming language to go off for this. I am checking out JavaScript, Python, and C++. I'm not sure what would be the best one though. Guidance would be appreciative!

&amp;#x200B;

I have the task to create a daemon application which should use Microsoft Graph Ressources. I have used MSGraph before but done so using various Client Libraries provided by Microsoft. This time I need to use a java based Code Generator ([Talend](https://de.talend.com/products/application-integration/esb-open-studio/?utm_campaign=DE%20Search%20-%20Branded%20-%20TOS%20%28German%29&amp;utm_content=talend%20open%20studio%20-%20epmb&amp;utm_creative=237896774635&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_term=talend%20open%20studio)) and I cannot use these libraries.

&amp;#x200B;

I've started to read the documentation around it and am now trying to get an access token for my application. I want to test my requests using Insomnia REST Client. I came across the follwing documentation which should elaborate of how such a request is made up:

&amp;#x200B;

 `POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1 Host: login.microsoftonline.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`  

`client_id=535fb089-9ff3-47b6-9bfb-4f1264799865` 

`&amp;scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2F.default` 

`&amp;client_secret=qWgdYAmab0YSkuL1qKv5bPX` 

`&amp;grant_type=client_credentials` 

&amp;#x200B;

See the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-service#4-get-an-access-token).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't get how to send this request, I have only used requests that used paramters in the endpoint string as well as headers for content and accept types. What are the other paramters?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how I understand it:

&amp;#x200B;

* URI Endpoint
* Header (Type)
* Body Value (client\_id)
* Body Value (scope)
* Body Value (client\_secret)
* Body Value (grant\_type)

&amp;#x200B;

I understand what these parameters mean but I don't get how to send the request - as I'm pretty new to this sort of thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I typed it that way in insomnia but I don't get a response. Can anyone offer some explanation here?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I have tried to search for explanatory sources but have not yet found any that fit the above model of description.",0,2,2019-07-19 09:59:29

Then I also read that there is a difference between subdomains with specific titles.
&gt; For e.g.: `http://www.example.com/` might be a web server, but `http://ftp.example.com` might be an ftp server or `http://mail.example.com` might be an mail server.


Now what does something like this mean `http://ftp.example.com`? Does it mean that we are trying to send files using `ftp` **over** `http` protocol via a web-browser? Isn't that kind of overkill. `ftp` is an application layer protocol so sending it over `http` which is also an application layer protocol will hamper performance.


I haven't used `ftp` much, but whatever I have used, I have done it via a terminal with commands like these -

```bash
ftp user@ftpdomain.com
OR
ftp user@192.168.0.5
```

**TLDR:** what is the difference between `ftp://ftp.adobe.com` and (say (this doesn't exist, firefox gives unsafe warning)) `http://ftp.adobe.com`.

The CMS side must be able to create news or blog-like articles with listing pages and individual article pages.

Some things that combine commerce needs with CMS-like features is the ability to include a slideshow / gallery type widget showing photos of the product from different angles. Plus of course a products listing page, tagged or otherwise categorized.

The store would be selling physical products with shipping requirements. Preferably the solution works with USPS and Square, but other ideas might be fine if the other requirements are good.

And for preference, I like RAD or very high level tools but where I can also dig lower level if needed to change things (without hacking any third party software).

Still relatively new at programming, I was just wondering if there's a way to do this that's not too difficult to implement!

Situation: I have two aerial drone images overlooking my stream in my backyard -- one taken from today and one taken from a week before. The images of the stream change slightly from today and last week: the image from today is larger in size (more pixels) because it was flown at a slightly different height and the picture also captured a bit more area than a week ago. However both images are both oriented in the same direction (e.g. facing north), and are looking straight down from a birds eye view.

I would like to overlay a grid on the images in the exact same places as the first week as the second week (to see how certain areas around the stream have changed), but I run into issues because the size of the image is slightly different and captures different areas. (The grid is made to line up with last week's image perfectly, but when pasted over the other image it of course will not capture the same area

Any thoughts? I tried to overlay a cyan colored pixel in the top left corner of both today's image and overlaid a cyan color pixel on the second image in pretty close to the same area (used them as 'markers'), had my program search for the cyan colored pixel and paste the grid on the image there, but that didn't work -- the corner of the grid matched up, but none of the boxes encompassed the same area and didn't stretch to the full image",2,5,2019-07-19 13:56:18

I'm building an app for which it would be extremely useful to have a database that I can call on constantly that would have a giant list of all/almost all geotagged photos in Flickr. I don't need the actual photos, just the metadata associated with them.

Flickr's API obviously limits this in a few ways. They won't return more than 4,000 photos in one call, then to actually get the GPS data for each of those photos takes one call per photo.

My immediate instinct is to just set up a python script that runs on a timer and gradually grabs all the two million or so photos. Once all that information is local I can hit it as much as I want.

This feels like the wrong method of doing things, but I don't see any other option. One operation on my app will probably use the amalgamated data from 10k+ photos. To my eye, that would be 10k+ requests to the Flickr API, which is untenable. But it also feels like I'm doing something wrong?

I am fairly new to web programming and the last time I made a website was with plain PHP, HTML/CSS and a MySQL database. Since I want to use my next project to actually learn something and not just finish the product, I thought about a better way for displaying data on my website.

The structure I want to change looks like the following. 

&amp;#x200B;

**""Back-End""**

I have several clients (raspberry PI) that send data (temperature, humidity etc) via a PHP POST requests to my server. The script then simply saves this information in a MySQL database and also detects / registers new clients.

**""Front-End""**

I just took a bootstrap template and have several PHP scripts that interpret and display the data. This is the part that bothers me the most. It just feels really old-school and not very effective. As soon as I change something in the database everything needs to be adjusted. I would really love to just access the data via 1 or 2 lines of (functional) programming.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any idea how I could access the data in the MySQL database more effectively ? 

I am willing to completely rewrite the code and change the programming language. Are their any frameworks, languages that do a better job ? It should be as flexible as possible. Or maybe I am using PHP incorrect and there are good tutorials for this specific problem

For context I'm pretty much a complete beginner so this problem may seem really simple to solve. I put the website where I got the code on the bottom of the post and the author put the link to his composite code on his Github, which is linked to the bottom of the article. His code also has a README. My issue is in Line 48 when i get ""AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get\_text'"". I have no idea how to move past this and would greatly appreciate help. I also deleted Line 10 ""from selenium import webdriver"" as the original author said that there was no use for it.

122,c92s8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/c92s8s/blockchain_topic_i_think_smartswap_overcomes/,"Blockchain topic: I think SmartSwap overcomes AtomicSwaps downfalls, thoughts?","SmartSwap is a P2P trading technology built on the Ethereum network. SmartSwap is 100% decentralized, eliminates the need for trust between the parties, overcomes some of the Atomic Swap disadvantages, and is a face value exchange. It’s secure, easy to implement, protects the user against losses in case of currency rate changes and it doesn’t require blockchains involvement to have code abilities and the same Hash algorithm (like Atomic Swap does). Using SmartSwap, a user is able to exchange crypto-for-crypto without the risk, hassle or expense or volatility that exists on other cryptocurrency exchanges.

**What I consider to be the benefits of the Smart Swap functionality**

When a user needs to change one crypto for another, they must have an account on an exchange. In order to make their exchange, they must accept the best price they can find from other traders. Further, if a coin changes in value, the exchange does not adjust the trade to accommodate this; users are constantly exposed to a risk of losing in trades because of a market shift. Currently, users must watch the market to make sure that their trades are not impacted by fluctuations.

**SmartSwap improves the way in which exchanges are carried out. Currently, exchanges work in the following way:**

* At the time of creating the order the trade is BTC is valued at $4,000 and will trade for 30 ETH (\~$133 each).
* If the ETH drop value by 5% user will receive 30 ETH, but the value is now $3,800 (\~$126 each) - user lost $200.
* Or If BTC increases in value by 5% (to $4,200) the user loses this gain in the trade as they will still only receive 30 ETH (\~$133 each), the increase in value is not applied at time of trade - user has lost $200 in value in the swap.

**Exchanges on the Element zero SmartSwap, example; Trade 1 BTC to ETH:**

* At the time of creating the order the trade is BTC is valued at $4,000 and will trade for same value, $4,000 in ETH
* If ETH drops in value by 5%, the user will receive 31.578 ETH ($4,000) - same face value equal to $4,000 of BTC
* If BTC increased value +5% user will end up with 31.5 ETH (equal to $4,000) - same face value equal to $4,000

Using SmartSwap, users trade will always be exact value:value match. If the prices of either coin fluctuate by the time the trade occurs, users will still receive the exact value of their coin in the traded coin.

I have over a month of record video where the videos are in `yyyy_mm_dd_hh_mm_ss` format.   Generally the bulk of videos are from 1300 to 1700-1900 but sometimes I have a day/session that looks like

    session 20180712
    2018_07_12_17_30_00 and run to 2018_07_13_0200

Besides above I was thinking of a brute force script that looked for a session ending at `2018_07_23_59_00` and the next day/session starts at `2018_07_00_01_00`.   From there I would copy the overlap until there was a large enough gap (similar to the function above).


The video files are from a dash cam that creates a new video every minute and they're either recordings of me as a Lyft driver or more important is an annual trip I make from Denver, Colorado to Anchorage, Alaska.

I intended to make a time lapse of each ""day"" along with an animated gif tracing my path.   Unfortunately the Lyft data is absolute massive @ 3 terabytes @ 80Mb per video and it would take a long time to manually sort these.   

The GPS data isn't an issue and its fairly immaculate because I am using GNS with GLONASS, Galileo, and GPS to pin point me down to a meter accuracy (far beyond good enough).   I've converted and started graphing the position data as UTM (meters) to track distance/average speed per day.    If I can't automatically sort the data, the graphs would show obvious breaks (/ in one day `/` and then  `/_/\` spikes in the next day).",2,2,2019-07-04 11:30:32

I got stuck on a problem where it gives a function definition in algebraic form and ask to create a recursive as well as iterative approach for this problem, I was able to create recursive solution since its quite easy, maybe because we are taught recursion and give it importance, but can't quite come up with iterative solution.

If you have read this book or maybe just want to help me solve this solution. Here it is.

f(n) such that

- n if n &lt;= 3
- f(n - 1) + 2f(n - 2) + 3f(n - 3)

I think I have decided what language I will use for making it.

Second, how should I structure the code. Like how to handle it. I know that in python (I don’t want to use python for this purpose) I could make a class with functions (maybe put in some decorators to specify the syntax needed to call that functions) to handle the user defined code. So when it recognizes for example a variable declaration, it calls getattr() on that class to get the function that handles that code.

I was originally thinking of making an interpreter, but decided it was too slow. If anyone can point me to a good tutorial on making a compiler that would be great. Is it possible to write some code in c++, compile it, copy the assembly via a deassembler and use that assembly code in the final file generated with my compiler, then use a assembler(I’m not totally sure what it’s called, but it makes an executable from the assembly file) to make a runnable application.

Hello all,

recently I've picked up Skyrim again after a few years hiatus. After experimenting with the in-game alchemy an interesting question popped into my head - is it possible to create a potion with 6 effects? The answer is yes, in theory.

For those unfamiliar with Skyrim's alchemy minigame, it goes something like this;

* There is a pool of about 100 different ingredients.
* Each ingredient has 4 effects, from about 50 possible effects
* Potions/Poisons are created when 2-3 ingredients are mixed
* A Potion/Poison will be 'successful' if the ingredients mixed have at least 1 effect common to at least 2 of the mixed ingredients.

A potion with 6 effects is possible, but there are more than 160,000 possible potions. Thats too much to check manually.

How could we create a program to look at all possible combinations and results, then filter said results to show only mixtures with 6 effects?

If you have any questions please fire away.",10,5,2019-07-13 11:29:48

It doesn’t have to be terribly fancy, but I’ll definitely aim for getting whatever features I can get my hands on (like context and something that can be trained).

The majority of my project is going to be .NET, but ultimately I doubt there are many (if any) such choices there, so any language will do.

Essentially my goal to find a library that I can train a bit, has basic chatbot chatting capabilities (the more natural the better, but dumb as a post will do if I that’s all there is), and I can wrap up in another application to use for myself. I don’t intend to deploy or sell the software, it’s purely for my own use.

Oh, and cheap would be good. I don’t mind spending money in em, but a lot of these bots are priced for corporate customers, not residential. They tend to charge a whole heap of a lot of cash for stuff. $50-200 one time is fine, but I expect corporate priced stuff will be a good bit more.

Ok, so here's the real issue. Where do I start? Now, I don't think I need someone actually writing code for me or anything of the sorts, but I am stumped in the sense that I really don't know where to even start.

So, I'd like ideas on suggestions on what kind of language do you think would work best for me, considering I am planning to do a cross-platform app (at least Win10 and Android) capable of touch screen controls, I eventually plan to add some form of database for user logins to store their preferences and I want to work with e-book formats and comic formats.

Besides, and probably most importantly: What kind of features would you like to see on an app such as this? If it were up to me I'd just display the book, lol, I dunno what stuff to add to it. And the UI, I might need some real help designing a proper UI, but I am just asking tips and hints from you chaps, I don't expect or want anyone to do the job for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm struggling a bit with the ""clean"" aspect in a particular area of our code.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a backend application.

So, here we have c \`PlanClient\` class, it's more of a \~\~data source\~\~ remote interface - it downloads \`Plan\`.

That downloaded \`Plan\` has wrong data mixed in it - invalid dates, invalid items.

We know how to filter out and modify the \`Plan\` so that it becomes correct.

We have to log in the database every \`Plan\` downloaded.

The \`PlanClient\` is used in several parts of the application  - the wrong should not be used and is harmful in those other parts of applicaiton.

&amp;#x200B;

We have made a class \`PlanSanitizer\` and injected it into the \`PlanClient\`.

We call its sanitize methods just before returning the sanitized \`Plan\` from \`PlanClient\`.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what we have is sort of clean: the \`PlanClient\` doesn't care about exact sanitization rules, it's just 1 line of code.

But we have concerns:

1. The client is triggering database-access. This one seems easy - it's a cross cutting concern - we do it for the logging (we actually store both the original \`Plan\` and the sanitized \`Plan\`).
2. The client is calling sanitization. Seems pecualiar - in our codebase what we call \`Client\` classes, are usually just some ""rmi clients"", not ""sanitized rmi clients"".

&amp;#x200B;

If we try to move sanitization and/or database-access out of the \`PlanClient\` class,

we are now required to duplicate the code across all users of the client class.

There's also an option of making a wrapper class, that calls the original class, then does the sanitization, like a decorator of some sort, but it needs some forwarding, and the naming game is hard :D.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you do in this situation? (even if it's a long-term refactoring plan)

I am a CS student, so I am quite sure there's a solution for the tasks I'm doing, but I don't really know what language/what applications would be necessary to do them, but I would imagine the coding for them wouldn't be terribly difficult.

To give an example of a task, I have to create folders within Google Drive, namely, 38 of them all named, say ""Lesson_S01"", ""Lesson_S02"" all the way to ""Lesson_S38"". (I would also have to create subfolders similarly named). I would also like to extract the link for each folder to link it at certain places in other documents. So I would like to get the link for each lesson folder from Lesson_S01 to Lesson_S38 (and perhaps put them into a .txt file in order so I can manually figure out where I want to link them). 

I am not asking for a coding solution, I am simply stating the tasks I am trying to do to try to give an idea of what I am trying to accomplish. What programs, if they exist, would allow me to accomplish such tasks within a browser?",8,2,2019-07-11 15:47:11

Should I reference the posts owner through the object Id of the user and store that in post? 

Or should I have an array of post ID's within the user object, with just the usernames first name and last name mentioned in the post? This way I can update all referenced posts if there is a change to the user record.

(Please keep in mind I'm not entirely sure of what I'm looking for, and I'm somewhat new to backend job queues/asynchronous execution)

Scenario: User sends a photo via an Android app to a webserver. Server must run some DL inference on the submitted picture, perform some calculations and send a text output back to the user.

Server will be a laptop with an RTX 2070. We were planning to make a Flask server, accept a POST request, then run inference by modifying darknet-YOLO to work with our model and weights. But that requires us to execute a command in the shell (with pexpect). But this doesnt seem like the best way, because if multiple clients make requests, they will have to wait for this command to complete/it may spawn several processes, risking a VRAM overflow/slowing down all running inferences etc with no control over them

I've found the python library MLQ to create a job queue and hand off the requests to a second process, but is there any way to make this as fast as possible, by running mutiple inference jobs in parallel on one GPU? In Python/Node.js etc.

Forgive me if this is the wrong place to put this. I am dating a guy who works in web development. He programs a website/software in the mortgage business. I would love some tips on what to ask him about his job. When he talks about his day, I try to ask probing questions but its difficult because I know next to nothing about programming. My go to questions are ""That sounds tough! How long will it take?"" or ""Do you feel confident about what you're doing?"" or ""What kind of projects do you have going on?""

To you who work in programming, what do you wish your SO would follow up on? What are some other probing questions I could ask that would make him feel heard about his job?",54,75,2019-07-11 22:41:24

You know how a language (C#) gives us ""in-built"" methods  [like .Split(), .ToString(), .Replace() etc etc) and  then stuff like [openfiledialog ,  . Anything].

Basically stuff that is famous, that already has a purpose, and is usually instanted like a class[with a new] or invoked like a method [with a .]. 

After googling I thought the name for these terms is API but I think thats wrong I'm having trouble understanding it can someone explain in simpler terms?",7,1,2019-07-12 02:47:05
