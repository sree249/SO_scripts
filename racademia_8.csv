1,cv0yyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/cv0yyt/what_do_you_write_your_documentationnotes_in_what/,What do you write your documentation/notes in? What is your workflow to avoid messy research?,"Hello everyone. Just wanted to know more about your methodology to organize data and export it to other formats when you do a research project.

I work in software engineering and most of my notes and research are in latex format and as I make experiments or discover useful data, I keep appending it on the file. It also has the added advantage that it's journal ready most of the time. [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) helps me keep it by chapters, but I've found myself wanting to query/process the data or export it to my phone for experiments.

I find [relational databases](https://www.mysql.com/) too obstructive due to the need to define the notes format beforehand and sometimes I want to change them on the fly or link them to references for the bibliography which may vary in size or format. Have thought of using non-relational but don't wanna invest time and energy on it until I'm sure it'd be adequate (plus don't see that many options for android parsing).

Have done some extremely fast documentations or notes using [vim + yaml](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yaml/index.htm), then query them in Python when I need to display them. And some other documents I've tried using [Restructured Text with Sphinx](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html) so that I can use the **make latex** option if I ever need to append it into a paper. But find more annoying to reference a bibliography in Sphinx when I could do it directly in latex and save a step.

Have also read that many enjoy using the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/documentation), but honestly I have never been able to integrate it into my workflow when it seems that vim + shell suffice. And so far I haven't read if it can easily turn into tex for papers so it feels not worth it for small projects or tests and even then, I still haven't been able to find the advantage of using it.

What is your preferred method or workflow to avoid a messy research? Do you have a favorite data type to store, parse and redact your research? Do you use some fancy project management application? I know it may be too much to ask, just wondered what's your setup.

**t.l.d.r.** What data format do you recommend that can be easily transferred, parsed, version controlled AND is human readable so that you can store and organize your research/turn it into papers?",4,6

I stumbled upon this book by chance, but I'm enjoying it quite a lot. If you're familiar with GTD, this book is like the perfect complement to GTD but to academic researchers.

Has anybody experience with this method? It seems like a very well thoughout idea and I will give it a go this year. 



How it works:

The book explains a methodology that can be implemented with any note-taking app (Evernote, OneNote, Joplin, etc), or even with pen and paper, to build a birthing pod of research ideas that can be used later when you need to start a new project. The core principle is that you, as a researcher, read *lots* of things, some of them not even related to your daily research task. Then, during your reading sesions, you'll come up with things that grab your attention or think that they might be cool to incorporate in near future projects. As a consequence, the methodology of the book explains how you can transform your research notes (notes on the margins, on a app, little bits in your notebook, word files, etc) into an standardized universal note repository (the slip-box, aka zettelkasten in German). These notes, once they reach critical mass will, will give you core ideas for future research projects.",8,6

I recently read [this article](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/why-do-nigerian-scammers-say-they-are-from-nigeria/) about why Nigerian scammers claim to be from Nigeria. I found this article very enjoyable to read, and I would like to know is where I could find more articles like this. What I like about this article is that this is accessible to the layperson but still includes significant thought, math, diagrams, and a good takeaway. It has the feel of an academic article (not Buzzfeed Clickbait, despite its leading title), but it's not incredibly arcane like many scholarly articles.

Is there a collection of such articles out there already? Articles with legitimate thought and math, but easily accessible by those who aren't experts in that field? I am especially interested in those that provide a mathematical model to back up their ideas. Any suggested articles, blogs, or original researchers would be appreciated.

Other examples:

[Collective Motion of Moshers at Heavy Metal Concerts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.1886v1.pdf) (great example of what I'm looking for)

[Ending the Myth of the St Petersburg Paradox](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/50515/1/MPRA_paper_50515.pdf)

XKCD's [What If?](https://what-if.xkcd.com/), but more technical. (e.g. I'm more interested in the mathematical model, not just results of calculations or simulations)

I wrote an article that shows the methodological flaws in another article and how the authors cannot come to the conclusion they did based on that process. I tried submitting my article to the same journal, it's a small one, but it's been long past their processing time and I've heard nothing. I've also tried to follow up a couple times. So now I look elsewhere, is it fair game to submit such an article elsewhere? What might be some publishing options? The article has a focus on euthanasia from a population health perspective. 

I plan to write a very similar article critiquing another paper. There are way too many people that have read this paper but somehow misinterpreted the results. In my opinion, the reason for that is that the write-up was poor, has misleading statements, and important findings are left out of the abstract and discussion. Before I get started on this second paper, I  thought I'd confirm if something like this is also publishable. The subject of the original article is euthanasia and its potential link with suicide rates.",6,4

9,cs5knw,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/cs5knw/my_experience_in_academia_sucks/,My Experience in Academia Sucks,"A lot of this is going to be unordered rant.

I think academia is a lot of bullshit. I can't tell you the number of times I've talked to a colleague about something I'm passionate/knowledgable about, and had them 'correct' me rudely. Most of the time they will know basically nothing about what they are talking about. This can extend anywhere from pop culture, to niche culture I'm privy to, to things in my field, to things wholly in my expertise. It doesn't seem to matter if they aren't even in my field, people will take shots at you when they clearly know basically nothing about the subject. It doesn't matter if they are senior to you or even below you as a student. There is really no limit that I've found for some individuals to try and one-up me. They could know literally nothing about the subject and they will still try to invent a reason why I'm wrong in idle conversation. I've has students aggressively try to argue with me that I don't know basic things about my thesis topic, and no amount of reasoning with them seems to make them not want to talk to me like I'm a fucking idiot. I wish I could say senior colleagues are a lot better, but the difference is marginal (a senior colleague is at least more likely to know what they are talking about).

The value of intellectual integrity is wildly low. If I try to qualify my statements responsibly with ""I think that"", ""it seemed to me like"", ""it might be"", or any other qualifying statement of sureness, people perceive me as inexperienced/unsure/weak. Meanwhile people will state shit that is simply not true extremely condescendingly without qualifiers. They will then not have the balls (or be completely delusional, I'm not sure) to own up to the fact that they guaranteed whatever they were saying. I once tried to communicate that I granted something was provable, but that it didn't matter in the current conversation, by saying ""That may be true, but..."", and I got yelled at that ""it's not that it may be true, it's PROVABLE"". Like, yeah dude, I fucking know it's provable, you have a PhD from a top school and you can't understand a basic modal statement?

My advisor has regularly said/employed motivated reasoning along the lines of ""this can't possibly work this way"" and ""this definitely compiles because I worked hard on it"". What do you know, it definitely ended up working that way, and your shit definitely did not compile. I've been told categorically false things extremely condescendingly, both in and outside of my field of expertise. Some of these have come at personal costs to me.

I've been told more times than I can count that I need to spend more time trying to talk to people. I didn't get taken seriously when I said that some colleagues were getting to the level of harassment/abuse. I once had a student above me randomly walk into the office and yell ""you want to quit already, this is too hard for you"" completely unprovoked while I was working.

It's fucking grating and has steadily made me lose confidence that competence is something worthwhile that gets you something in this world. It is legitimately depressing to wake up and know that ""experts"" in your field can't have basically reasonable conversations about a range of topics. Conversations that modestly bright undergraduate students could (and still can, in my experience) have just fine. You get a vague amount of clout and it puts your head so far up your own ass that it makes you a fucking moron.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the values/experience leading up to academia (research and conversations with other stellar students in undergrad) were completely separate from whatever this is. People were actually interested in learning, and willing to discuss things rationally and grow together. The quality of basic/idle intellectual conversation, or conversation about a shared subject of interest was far better as an undergrad. Everything wasn't some big brawl for ego points. I think the reality is that the more competent people actually went off and did worthwhile things in real jobs (or at least the extent it was about ego, people still were capable of basically reasonable conversations without having their heads inflated). At least that's my only explanation for what happened.

I should have just tried to get a real job instead of thinking that this process would be intellectually challenging/interesting/enriching/valuable. I could have gotten a basic job and spent nights reading/studying by myself and I'd probably be in a much better position as an intellectual and as a knowledgable person than spending the extra years in university to get yelled at, cajoled, and condescended to by people who hardly have basic critical thinking skills despite having however many publications or awards etc. It is legitimately depressing to think back to all of the unrelentingly dumb conversations I've had in the last few years and realize these people are looked to as luminaries or whatever.",23,14

I started off doing undergraduate physics in a university thats ranked okay and I did very well there (just to give an idea I got 94% in my final year dissertation).

I managed to get a masters place in a university comparable to Cambridge in theoretical physics and I just struggled a lot and my grades weren't very good at all (all my marks were between 50% and 60% and I failed 3/8 exams which is below 50%). I just found it extremely difficult because I didn't really make any friends so I was trying to figure out everything by myself instead of asking questions mainly because I was too intimidated by how smart my peers seemed and also I felt like I would be wasting the professors time by asking questions. I now realise this is silly and I should have just asked but I can't go back.

I guess now I have a small chance to redeem myself by doing well in the dissertation but I feel so unmotivated because I feel like I've just wasted this year.

I feel like a complete failure. My plans were to do a PhD after this masters but I doubt I will get accepted anywhere with those grades. Before I left my old university my project supervisor sent me an email hoping that I would do a PhD with him but I'm not sure he would want to take me on after the grades I've received.

I spent a long time on these papers and asked my professor many questions through email (online class), only to STILL fail them. With the 25% paper, I was told that I didn't write an essay, and that I only compiled quotes and references into a paper. She refused to read it over again. I only used 2 direct quotes on that paper. I offered to meet her during her office hours to discuss the grade, but she told me that she doesn't have any office hours. I asked her if I can submit them to her early to get feedback before the deadline, and she said that she doesn't offer feedback on papers. Okay, so after that score, I worked even harder on my papers to improve my scores. 
Then I received a D only a few papers later, this time her reasoning was that I did not fully answer the prompt. Because there is no option on the rubric to deduct points for missing parts of the prompt, she deducted points from my sources, even though I used all my references meaningfully. She told me that she would not review my paper unless I wrote comments for each of the sections she incorrectly deducted points for. I completed this task, and her response was basically ""While you wrote good comments, your actual paper did not explain these concepts well, so no additional credit will be given."" The comments were just rephrasing everything I had already said in my paper...
 The final paper in which I received a 50%, I asked her about 5 questions in email about the prompt to make sure I understood everything correctly. Spent a week writing it (not that it matters), but when I received my score and asked her about it, she replied that I missed adding in 2 details and therefore, removed 75% of the points for the sources section on the rubric. I offered to have a phone call or send her comments on my paper again, but she refused to even look at it. 
At this point, I told her that I would be pursuing a grade appeal. Do you guys think I have a case? The class averages for nearly all these papers was in the 50% range.",8,1

I recently broke up with my girlfriend who's an academic, and I feel awful. She's a really sweet person, but her life is really up in the air right now and I think she just can't think long-term yet. She's extremely stressed out- her current post doc position isn't working out (PI is a famous professor who's super uninvolved in her lab, and a few other postdoc a have recently left), and shes applying anywhere she can that will offer a work visa (she's applying for a green card). I, however, know that I want a committed relationship. I just finished grad school, am starting a stable job, and don't really care to move around a ton- I wanna start a life. She made it pretty clear that she doesn't want to commit to anything big for a few years due to her career, and I just didn't think I could be happy like that. As much as her ambition, thoughtfulness, and passion for learning and knowledge is inspiring, and she is a really kind person, Id be sacrificing my whole life (stability, friendships and family in my city, limiting my own career, etc.) to follow around an academic if things had gotten serious between us. 

I just feel terrible that I'm not strong or understanding enough to have a partner who's in the thick of academia and all this uncertainty. I know life isn't a Disney movie and am not expecting her to quit academia and come back to me of course. 

I guess I'm just looking to alleviate my guilt here. Is an academic + stable career relationship even possible? I know she really benefitted and appreciated the support of a partner through the chaos of her career, and I'm really worried about her. I'm brave but if I'm not really able to ride the academia thing with someone else psychologically, seems best in the long run to part ways? Ugh it just sucks.

TL;DR: I'm on a kind of Math post-master career crisis, trying to figure out if it's only some kind or minor burnout or if I really need a change.

\-----

Hi, Math student here. Recently got my master degree and I'm hesitant about getting a Phd. Even more, I'm absolutely messed up about my career future plans.

I'm an average student, neither brilliant nor bad. I'm also a musician. I've been playing and studying music since I was a girl, and I really really love that. Recently, I've resumed my music activity and it's turning a little more professional (before, it was all pretty amateur).

During the last year of my Master, I started feeling kind of sick about everything about my master: Taking my last exam took was ridiculously hard because I couldn't just get the job done. Doing my thesis took a simillar effort. I just got kind of sick of all, like really didn't wanting to be doing that, even having a really interesting topic to study, nice courses, and awesome advisors. I can't blame the master itself at all.

But my mind seemed to think different. Probably tired. Since undergrad, I've been many years in a nonstop studying and working routine. But on the other hand, this mental fatigue seems to vanish when it comes to music. A couple years ago, I allowed myself to engage in a little new music activities (leaving one of my jobs to get some free time) hoping that would help me to cope with academic pressure. Maybe it did, but also got really engaged with new musical projects, got motivated about taking classes, and a huge etc that I didn't expected. On the opposite hand, I had to do a huge mental effort to get every little task of my math work done.

Fortunately, I did it. Got my Master degree, forcing my mind to focus on that and promising myself a new reward: Taking a couple ""free"" months (i.e, not starting a Phd yet, no research activities, etc.) to recover and see how I felt about that. Maybe a Phd is not for me? or I'm just tired? I supposed that a little stop would help me to figure it out. Also, in that time I wanted to focus a little more on my music projects, for personal enjoyment in the first place but also with a professional perspective. I'm far away from making a living right now, but it might (or might not) be possible in a future... If I work hard to get over the missed time. The only clear thing was that I needed to stop and think.

Now, that time is over and I find myself facing a new teaching job (not a student anymore = no funding) and working on an article with my former advisors. Or at least trying to. That recovering time went off too quiclky and wasn't even a real pause. Now I feel like trapped again in the academic lifestyle, without really taking my ""musician holydays"", and even more confused than before. I feel absolutely uncapable of facing a Phd right now and, in fact, i'm feeling uncapable of working on any research. I'm supposed to be working on the same topic of my thesis and I can't even get little things done. Looks like this little break took away my last tiny bit of willpower. Of course, this is seriously affecting my productivity so I spoke with my coauthors about this (we still have a advisor-student like relationship). They understood it and told me it's normal, and told me to take some days (a week or so) off (no article-related work for me). These days are right now and it feels great. I'm just doing the same ""nothing"" that in the previous days, but with no guilt. My mind is getting active and curious again... But not about math. I've been doing mostly music related activities. Also facing some stressful situations around my musical projects but I feel strong enough for that.

So next week I have to get back to full math mode (teaching and researching, not just teaching). And I'm not feeling ready yet. On the other hand, it looks like a longer break will lead to even less motivation to getting back. Even when it's supposed to be a recovering pause.

Up to this point I have to say, I've considered the possibillty that academia and math are not for me and I might have a chance on a musical career, even if it's a little late for a change. But also, it might be also the fatigue tricking me and making me crave for a radical change. On this last months there wasn't a single day when I didn't daydream about just kicking out all the academic shit and and go full time musician.

If I go to my next meeting and tell this to my coauthors, I guess they will be probably cool with it. Maybe they tell me to get another week off, who knows. But I really don't know what is the wise path to take right now, or how much of this ""rest"" is enough to keep going without being too much (some colleagues warned me about the risk of taking a too long break and loosing training). Also, I'm still uncapable to say if I got really sick of math and academy or it's just a phase.

40,crr8us,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/crr8us/the_feminization_of_labour_market/,The Feminization of Labour Market,"Labour migration continues to be one of the dominant forms of global migration attracting numerous skilled and unskilled workers from the economic peripheries of the developing world to the economic centres of the developed world. It is generally assumed that these movements are male dominated due to historical reasons which have always put males in the forefront of labour migration. However, the gender perspective on global migration suggests that there are increasing numbers of female immigrants, in contemporary migration, joining the labour markets in developed countries, a phenomenon called the feminization of labour market.

According to Kofman *et al.* (2000:105), the feminization of labour market refers to the increased number of women in paid employment. It also describes the flexibilisation of labour for women and men, a fallout of the changing nature of employment where irregular conditions once thought to be the hallmark of women’s secondary employment have become widespread for both sexes; informal activities, sub-contracting, part-time work and home-based work have proliferated while rates of unionisation have declined (Standing, 1999; quoted in Kanji and Menon-Sen, 2001:1).

The increase in number is caused by the growing availability of job opportunities for women in receiving countries which has an impact on female emigration on origin countries; in other words, when the autochthonous female population of the receiving country experience economic upward mobility, two things happen: firstly they leave their household in need of care, and secondly they leave behind their low paid jobs; consequently, the need for female immigrants emerge to fill the gaps in the households and other low paid economic sectors where women are employed. This process, in receiving countries, leads to a female dual labour market characterized by the existence of an informal and deregulated sector for immigrants on the one hand, and a formal, regulated and high paid sector for the locals on the other hand.

I am a associate professor and program director for the PhD in a health services research PhD program. Our model is not to admit PhD students with a specific faculty member, rather we admit students and then work throughout their program to match them up with a research area, data source(s), and then researcher(s) to mentor them. Often these students are accessing health system data and so are working with faculty from other than our department.

We have a student who has been difficult to mentor: they have maintained an attitude that the faculty don't have anything to teach them (an air of superiority), expecting accommodations to be made, insisting on challenge exams instead of coursework (but then either not passing the exam, or deciding at the last minute to ""just take the class"", wasting the time of the faculty who graciously created an exam), missing classes often, failed the comprehensive examination on the first attempt (but passed on retry), just a difficult student (whose intention is to go immediately into industry as a data scientist) but continues to limp along well enough to not get kicked out.

I cannot find anyone willing to mentor the dissertation process and project - this student has alienated most of my faculty. I also don't want to do it personally, based on this student's attitude and work ethic. 

What do I do?

Then, of course, two professors will send me back times that coincide with one another and I'm forced to send out additional emails asking for additional availabilities. 90% of grad school life is sending emails and I would LOVE a way to streamline this process.

Is there a program out there that I just haven't run across yet? I know there are some programs where you can send your calendars out and have the recipient book a slot with you, but that feels weirdly inappropriate to me, as a PhD student, to send out to professors. Any thoughts?

Edit: Just discovered Boomerang Calendar which is a Chrome extension that lets you a) email interactive images of your actual Google calendar with your busy times/availabilities or b) or lets you email your availabilities (e.g., ""Friday, September 3 from 1 - 4 PM,"" etc.) with a couple of mouse clicks (versus writing out/copying and pasting all of your availabilities every other email).

I got this response:

&gt;If you can't handle your parents while studying away from home and only seeing them in the holidays while they finance you at an Ivy League then you can't handle academia. It's extremely challenging becoming an English professor, and you will face a lot trying to get there. Perhaps you should research the realities of becoming an English professor and then weigh up your options. View your parents as practice for what you'll need to get through to become a professor

Now, I understand that the field is difficult to get into and presents unique challenges, but what actually are they? Because it seems ridiculous to imply that they’re anything like the abuse I’ve endured. 

I replied this:
&gt; I actually don’t understand this. How is academia anything like having abusive parents? I’m prepared to do the academic work; I’m already doing research and helping edit syllabi and it’s my first year. I’m hoping to become more prepared to deal with difficult colleagues and students. (I tutor and work in a writing center right now to help me prepare for that.) I’ve also talked with multiple professors about how they got into the field and what it’s like and I understand that it’s hard. My friends in grad school and my professors have been through a lot, and I understand what it takes to keep going through that, but none of it seems similar to the abuse I get at home. In academia, is anyone going to come into the bathroom while I’m showering and yell at me until I cry? Are people going to tell me my dog is a better person than I am? Am I going to be screamed at on a daily basis? Are people going to take the locks off my doors and not let me leave when I’m crying because they’re yelling at me about how I’m a terrible person? Are people going to threaten me with bodily harm and make me feel unsafe? How does enduring those things make me more prepared to handle teaching, writing papers, and whatever administrative stuff I need to do?Seriously, if being an academic is anything like having abusive parents, I don’t want to do it.

And they doubled down, saying:
&gt;Again, I think you need to do some research about what it's like getting in to academia. I only finished my MA and I have absolute horror stories about my experiences. Seriously, read up about the reality of what it's like trying to succeed in academia. Things are very different when you're no longer in first year looking in and you've experienced the realities of trying to climb the ivory tower ladder

So this is me trying to find out about other’s experiences. I’ve talked to many professors about their paths, and while it sounds challenging, it doesn’t compare to the mental torture my parents put me through.

A career at the university would include working as an admin (don't like, see: comments on management), becoming a big fundraiser (yawn), or becoming famous as a scientist (unlikely).  A major driving factor outside the professional considerations is that the college town wasn't for me (a non-football-loving, non-church-going urbanista).

In addition to this, I have a further paper, I'm not sure if it's eligible. For the sake of anonymity, I'll summarise as best possible...

The paper is in an international methods journal as part of a special issue co-authored with a colleague from another university. It details two case studies (both previously published in full elsewhere) in order to shed light on and illustrate the how such methods can benefit a wider community of scholars. One of the case studies that the paper draws on is published in full in another paper also included in our universities REF submission (by another colleague and the lead author of the paper). As the paper provides new insights drawn from two case studies, I would argue that this constitutes 'research' under the REF definition but I'm concerned that it may constitute a review instead, which wouldn't be eligible?

I appealed the rejection by replying to the editor. Now it's been almost 2 months since I sent that e-mail and I haven't heard anything. Not even an acknowledgement of my e-mail. Expecting the rejection to be sustained, I prepared my manuscript for a different journal and am just waiting for some finality from the first journal before submitting it again. Yet I don't feel like I can e-mail the editor about its status because from asking people (on reddit) about appealing rejections I was warned (after the fact) that it is a good way to damage your reputation.

So ______ is a PhD student who has finished courses, completed, passed qualifying exams with flying colors, and is in great standing in their lab as of the beginning of the Spring 2019 semester.

However. There is a new grad program committee head as of a few weeks ago. For some ungodly reason this guy looked at ____s transcripts from last fall and decided that he didn’t feel that the courses approved by the previous committee head were acceptable (he claimed two of the classes taken weren’t worth the credits the school had assigned them as so he is removing credits) and has rescinded ______s ‘completion’ of credit requirements.

Obviously this causes a lot of problems including putting a lot of new research to a halt if ____ has to go back to taking classes to please this one guy. They have been doing only research for a semester and a summer and are in the middle of some important things. They are pissed, their PI is pissed, but this guy won’t back down about it. 

In my experience it’s not ‘legal’ for schools to do this. You agree to the course progression that is decided when you start and any new changes only affect the students entering during that and each following year. The committee at the time the courses were taken approved the credits with no issue. Does this chair have the right to overturn their previous ruling after the fact? 

I couldn’t find any specific policies on our university website. Any advice before they head into a meeting with the guy tomorrow? 

They have not yet gone to the Dean but that is the next step.",6,4

91,cx47dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/cx47dl/what_is_your_honest_opinion_on_accomodations_for/,"What is your honest opinion on accomodations for a student with mental health problems, but has a good GPA?","I was recently told that I would not be given accomodations on two grounds, my current good GPA of 3.8, and, what to them was a lack of ICD or DSM codes in the specific format they wanted.  I can correct this, in a few months time at the next PSYC appointment, but then I still have the issue of overcoming their objections due to my GPA.  

The GPA doesn't reflect a few facts:

* I benefited from academic renewal after four failures.  Counting these would result in a GPA of 2.77, and this is the GPA utilized by most other colleges for admission into their graduate programs.  The failed classes are still on my record, just not in my internal college GPA calculation
* I have had to withdraw from a semester due to mental health problems, but I withdrew before it was put onto my transcript
* the school's own counselor recommended I go inpatient, and said I should use ""medical withdrawl"" to do so.  
   * Medical withdrawl, IIRC, would prevent these things being on my transcript, but not in calculations for financial aid
* The added stress of explaining to instructors why I failed to get an assignment in on time, instructors either accepting it late or not, and then the huge added stress of compensating for these failures.  
* I was blessed with instructors last semester, who despite the fact that I didn't disclose my problems to them, never the less, I have reason to suspect they helped my grade.  One, I was one of the only students who participated in answering questions (sometimes interrupting before she was finished asking) and I was asked to allow other students to answer.  I then waited for those long pauses before answering.  The other I did the best they'd ever seen on an exit exam, probably thanks to ASD and some mania.  I finished in 10 minutes with 100% in comparison to other students who mostly got 70s, and took the full 50 minutes (this was a physics class)

&amp;#x200B;

My problems are numerous, and they focused on a narrow set of statistics which doesn't show the problems I face every day that are not encountered by my classmates who are gifted with better mental health than I am.  

Main diagnoses and related problems:

* ASD
   * anxiety
      * Giving presentations is very difficult, but tolerable
      * I have the general feeling of anxiety from the morning until I return home
   * social problems, poor grades in classes that require conversation in class
      * That english class where I did poorly because of this still bothers me
   * very shy at telling anybody when I need help, no friends in class to rely on for notes and help
   * This helped me in physics and math, courses I am no longer taking, but which contributed to my good GPA.  EX: last semester I did so good in physics ( [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/97d0/557e1f02f6e9b7f10a5d789c84cc653a8d8b.pdf](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/97d0/557e1f02f6e9b7f10a5d789c84cc653a8d8b.pdf) )
* Bipolar
   * Mania helped one semester ( the spring one)
   * depression did me in on two semesters (the last one being the summer semester)

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest fears probably cannot even be alleviated with any accommodations:

* withdrawl affecting student loans
   * repayment may become due the moment I am no longer enrolled half time, although I'm not sure
   * SAP may very well be affected
* academic difficulties affecting GPA for addmission into other programs not recognizing academic renewal 
   * there's probably no hope to fix the 2.77 GPA now

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions to you professors, and perhaps other students:

* would you disagree with someone who had these problems getting accomodations?  despite the high institutional GPA?  
* Should I not pursue this any further?  (my fear is when I need help, I will not have anything that says I can get it)
* Should I just get the documentation with the the codes to the accuracy they would like, and then, if they disagree again, note that the GPA doesn't take all the other things into account?",12,10

1. I know I am way more passionate about film/media/dance but am choosing to pursue the PhD route as I feel it might be easier to create a more stable life and path for myself financially. However I am so worried that this passion won’t “die” and I won’t have time for these hobbies on the side while I pursue my PhD and the years thereafter. Or even worse- I’m worried I will always feel unfulfilled. Don’t get me wrong, I was a strong student and do have a passion for research and becoming a psychologist but I would not say it’s my #1. 

2. I am now reading a bunch of stuff online that basically says getting a PhD and having a life in academia can be pretty unstable too! Like not having a choice really where you end up geographically, not being able to date as much, etc. I’m worried that I’m spending my prime years when at some point I want to be finding someone and settling down and starting a family.

I have been always interested in science  until I got to see the reality of what the scientific niche has to offer  to the world, Im particularly referring to what is known as academia.

A  dysfunctional organization of malversed individuals (in general, not  everybody) who seek power and recognition by their peers forming  something that resembles a cartel organization.

Things got bad when I noticed that my supervisor was a temperamental bitch  whose insecurities have to permeate through humiliating others and  disqualifying in mean ways. So, you know, he can reassure himself.

So  I wasnt really happy but still ok since he is almost never in lab and I  used to have a strong interest in producing some knowledge. Later I  started to notice how other supervisors are basically the same copy, a  bureaucrat who pretends to be scientist, pretends to be a leader and  pretends to be a manager while their subordinates get the job done. In  many cases with horrible treatment, like mine. But I was stuck by then due to financial constrains, I needed to lock that position while I worked on some other things on the side.

Ive  always had difficult to accept authority but this dude in particular is  the kind of idiot that oppresses others, even though, you know, he is  objectively speaking an idiot. Liar as well. 

Long  story short, he gets mad for instance if I show more advanced knowledge  than him lol. At  some point some people even saw me more as a leader because, well I do  care more about the science than how my name looks in a fucking piece of  paper lol.

Keep in mind that seeing your name in as many papers as possible is also what drives many people in this shit circus.

On  the other hand, not that I like to hang out with people, but when I  started to notice how the general atmosphere is complete misery, I just  decided to stay away from everybody. Away from the zombies.

I  still wanna finish this shit just because is convenient and it has  opened me doors that will benefit me for the rest of my life, dont get  that wrong, so I had to try to elucidate the causes of this fiasco.

How  my supervisor could be so incompetent and yet reach a good position in  something where performance and results are supposed to measure you?

The  answer is simple!!!. Because thatś not how you reach success in  science. You reach it by entering the mafia dynamic and licking asses  aaaall daaaay loooong. Yeah babe give me that ass, Im gonna lick it  because I also wanna be a professor.

Though it convincingly looks like the culprit of human intellect LOL LOOK:

But thats a different story, coming back...

It  turns out that academia and universities are nothing more than  student/article factories where quantity matters more than quality.  Incompetence is rampant even at those levels since it is damn easy to  get to do a PhD. Itś cheap and it has no value. Let alone a postdoc.  Just for perspective in some places an employee in McDonalds earns more  than a postdoc and gets more social benefits since a postdoc is  considered something like a student position.

He already mentioned that quite probably he will be able to get me some kind of funding when I'm there (only April), but I can't study in Germany without this funding. 

&amp;#x200B;

In November I'll be heading to Germany. This trip's purpose is to getting to know the university and having some meetings with my professor about his research proposal. This will be the best opportunity for mentioning my financial situation. How do you think I should approach it? Should I be honest and tell him that I wouldn't be able to study the PhD without funding?

Within the hour he responded saying that he would write me a great review and try to get it in by the 9th but because he was busy, it might slip into the next weekend. Well the 9th passed, and I sent him a short email on the 13th asking if he could give me an ETA, and when I heard nothing I sent another email on the 21st... Still nothing. I'm kinda freaking out because I'm basically accepted, they just want to confirm my degree, but my advisor is not being responsive at all. How much more should I bug him? I obviously don't want to aggravate him. My program has not given me a deadline, but they have sent me two emails asking when I'll have my rec letter in, so I know they are waiting. I'd ask someone else, but they specifically asked for him.",3,5

Officially the document comes from the University but listed at the end of the report has all our names as contributors. 

Just wondering how to cite it? I was thinking of putting everyone's names but 

a) that's a lot of names in my field (the biggest pub I have is with 4 others and that's a bit of an outlier as my other ones have max 2 co-authors) and 

b) there's no 'authorship' and our names are all listed in alphabetical order (I could simply do that - but still point 'a' makes this a little weird and also my name is towards the end of the alphabet :P).

I could just write 'University of Name (2019) - Title of the report' or simply just 'Title of the report'.

Thoughts?

Thanks!",4,13
