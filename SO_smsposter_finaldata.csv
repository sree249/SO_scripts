//VSCODE
This is an issue from VSCode. To fix it execute the following command 
tsc --init
//to initialize the tsconfig.json in the folder.

//VISUAL STUDIO
In order to prevent functions to be in global scope, you can add export {}; on top (or just export this function):
// 1.ts
export {};

function test(){
    console log(""File 1 Error"");

// 2.ts
export {};

Don't copy the .ts files. You only need the compiled .js files in the scripts directory (unless you are doing something unusual with TypeScript source from there).
Then in your tsconfig.json file, add an exclude directive to exclude wwwroot/scripts/**/* in your IDE.

It's deprecated base on Google Document 

getActiveNetworkInfo is deprecated on API 29.
getAllNetworkInfo is deprecated on API 23.

So, If you want to find the Network Connection status, you can use this code.
private fun isNetworkAvailable(context: Context): Boolean {
    val connectivityManager = context.getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE) as ConnectivityManager
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
        val nw      = connectivityManager.activeNetwork ?: return false
        val actNw = connectivityManager.getNetworkCapabilities(nw) ?: return false
        return when {
            actNw.hasTransport(NetworkCapabilities.TRANSPORT_WIFI) -> true
            actNw.hasTransport(NetworkCapabilities.TRANSPORT_CELLULAR) -> true
            //for other device how are able to connect with Ethernet
            actNw.hasTransport(NetworkCapabilities.TRANSPORT_ETHERNET) -> true
            //for check internet over Bluetooth
            actNw.hasTransport(NetworkCapabilities.TRANSPORT_BLUETOOTH) -> true

        }

13,57277759,57277882,answer,"
You can find all the info in the official doc

This class was deprecated in API level 29.
  Callers should instead use the ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback API to learn about connectivity changes, or switch to use ConnectivityManager#getNetworkCapabilities or ConnectivityManager#getLinkProperties to get information synchronously. Keep in m`ind that while callbacks are guaranteed to be called for every event in order, synchronous calls have no such constraints, and as such it is unadvisable to use the synchronous methods inside the callbacks as they will often not offer a view of networking that is consistent (that is: they may return a past or a future state with respect to the event being processed by the callback). Instead, callers are advised to only use the arguments of the callbacks, possibly memorizing the specific bits of information they need to keep from one callback to another.

You can use something like:
if (connectivityManager != null) {
    if (if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
       NetworkCapabilities capabilities = connectivityManager.getNetworkCapabilities(connectivityManager.getActiveNetwork());
       if (capabilities != null) {
           if (capabilities.hasTransport(NetworkCapabilities.TRANSPORT_CELLULAR)) {
               //...
           }
       }
   } else {

Ever since the last update, chrome started showing that message to me too. Not really an answer regarding spring, but you can add the cookie flag to the header of the session. In my case, since I'm using spring security, I intend to add it when the user logs in, since I'm already manipulating the session in order to add authentication data.
For more info, check this answer to a similar topic: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43250133

Your project is in SDK version >= 33.0.0, but the expo package version seems to be older. If your expo-cli version is older than 2.21.2, run npm install -g expo-cli to get the latest version. 
Or, you can change sdkVersion and dependencies to an older version to match the expo-cli doc.Run expo --version to get the expo-cli version. For example, if using expo-cli 2.19.5, you should 

app.json, change sdkVersion to ""32.0.0"",
In package.json, change these dependencies:

{
  ""react-native"": ""https://github.com/expo/react-native/archive/sdk-32.0.0.tar.gz"",
  ""expo"": ""^32.0.0"",

51,58811819,60302130,answer,"
I wouldn't suggest changing the budget sizes as they are meant just for this - warn you your bundles are growing too big. 
You may consider 2 thing:

Lazy loaded modules for parts of the application that are not visible in the initial screen. You may also combine this with some pre-loading strategy to avoid consequent delays in bundle fetching.
If you've already done the above then most probably the problem is in some (maybe new) import that's adding a lot of code. Some new library you may be importing in multiple places. I've seen this when we started using an external component and imported it in 3 different places. The solution was to put the component in a lazy-loaded module and import in the modules that needed it. 

Hope this helps.

Update: I see your edit question. For short answer you can only fix by using webpack-bundle-analyzer to analyze the bundle size and see which package affect your bundle size and remove it
You can see in angular.json there is the config for budget look like this
""budgets"": [
    {
        ""type"": ""initial"",
        ""maximumWarning"": ""2mb"",

Remove this and you can build without error. But I would not recommend you to remove it because this config will let you know the size of your application and you can improve the performance of the app by remove unnecessary code to reduce the size.

Disabling entire Gate Keeper is definitely not a good idea as it will result running any type of program on your system.
You can add Dart to the white list by running this in terminal:
sudo spctl --add ""Path_to_flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart""

You might require to reboot the system in order to apply the changes.
There are several other binaries other than Dart that may get blocked as well.
You can run GateKeeper script to fix the issue:

In case someone is stumbling uppon this question while wondering about array spread operations instead of objects:
I benched different methods to accomplish:

"
74,55843097,58569057,answer,"
The cost of spreading is significant. We're talking 2 orders of magnitude here.
const { x, y } = z

z = { x, y: y + 1 } // faster
z = { ...z, y: y + 1 } // slower

While they both accomplish similar things they are very different in their performance characteristics. But it will depend, if and how your JavaScript is transpiled.
For example, Babel will actually emit something which is similar to the faster variant if you target ES2015 but if you target ES2017 you'll get the slower variant, as-is. If you target ECMASCRIPT_2018 with the Google Closure Compiler you get the slower variant. With the TypeScript compiler you end up with twice as many objects because it does nested Object.assign calls.
While spreading is slower you're still getting a lot of ops per second. It's just that if you do it the boring way you'll get a lot more ops per second. 
I put together a jsperf example to illustrate this.
https://jsperf.com/the-cost-of-spreading/1
If you have a hot code path that does spreading, consider direct construction. Otherwise, don't bother.

76,55843097,55843172,answer,"
Yes, spreading a variable which refers to an object into another object requires the interpreter to look up what the variable refers to, and then look up all the enumerable own properties (and the associated values) of the object that gets spreaded so as to insert into the new object. This does indeed take a bit of processing power.
But, on modern computers, and on modern JS engines, the processing power required is next to nothing; what does it matter, when millions of instructions can be processed each second? A handful of key-value pairs is nothing to worry about.
Unless you've identified that you're spreading an object with tons of key-value pairs, and it's actually causing a performance bottleneck, it would be a better idea to avoid premature optimization and aim to write clean, readable code instead (which may well invoke using spread syntax often). For a large employees array, the second approach is more readable than the first.
(though, you also might consider using .map, to keep the code even DRY-er:)
const employeesInitial = [
  {
    employeeId: 123,
    employeeName: 'p'
  },
  {
    employeeId: 456,
    employeeName: 'q'
  },
  {
    employeeId: 789,
    employeeName: 'r'
  }
];
const employees = employeesInitial.map((obj) => ({ ...obj, ...commonParams }));

I have find out the best way to add an action sheet with cancel and as much action as needed.
Create an UIViewController extension with type alias:
//MARK: - Alert that shows an action sheet with cancel 
extension UIViewController {
  typealias AlertAction = () -> ()
  typealias AlertButtonAction = (ActionSheetLabel, AlertAction)

  func showActionSheetWithCancel(titleAndAction: [AlertButtonAction]) {
    let actionSheet = UIAlertController(title: nil, message: nil, preferredStyle: .actionSheet)

for value in title {
  actionSheet.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: value.0.rawValue, style: .default, handler: {
  (alert: UIAlertAction!) -> Void in

    value.1()

}))
}
actionSheet.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: ActionSheetLabel.cancel.rawValue, style: .cancel, handler: nil))
self.present(actionSheet, animated: true, completion: nil)
  }
}

Then, in the class or other place where you want to use it, add the method this way:
//MARK: - UIAlert action sheet title
enum ActionSheetLabel: String {
  case camera = ""Camera""
  case photoLibrary = ""Album""
  case cancel = ""Cancel""
}

//MARK: - Class example where to use the action sheet action
class CameraHandler {

fileprivate let currentVC: UIViewController!

func openCamera() { 
// Open user camera
}
func openPhotoLibrary() { 
// Open user photo library
}

  // Method example of this action sheet
  func showActionSheetWithCameraAndLibrary(vc: UIViewController) {

    //This is the way to use the extension
    vc.showActionSheetWithCancel(titleAndAction: [
      (ActionSheetLabel.camera, { [weak self] in self?.openCamera() }),
      (ActionSheetLabel.photoLibrary, { [weak self] in self?.openPhotoLibrary() })

You can pass a closure  and call it in the handler something like this should work. 
Also not  sure why you were passing the UIViewController , as you're already defining the function in a extension UIViewController therefore i allowed my self to remove it and used self.present instead .  
extension UIViewController {
func showActionSheetWithCancel(title: [ActionSheetLabel], action: @escaping () -> ()?) {
    let actionSheet = UIAlertController(title: nil, message: nil, preferredStyle: .actionSheet)
    for value in title {
        actionSheet.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: value.rawValue, style: .default, handler: {
            (alert: UIAlertAction!) -> Void in
           // action
            action()

        }))
    }
    let alertAction = UIAlertAction(title: ActionSheetLabel.cancel.rawValue, style: .cancel) { (_) in
        action() // or for cancel call it here
    }
    actionSheet.addAction(alertAction)
    self.present(actionSheet, animated: true, completion: nil)


  }
}

As you can see @escaping () -> ()? is optional so you can pass nil too .

You could try using 'mix-blend-mode', the background color of your image will match with the background color of it's parent.
Please note that this might not work with your image since you are using a gradient or it could happen that your gradient will be replaced by only one color.
It's also not compatible with some browsers.

There are sooooo many ways at going with this. You could match the gradient perfectly, set the image as the background and make it cover the page. Gradients would be really hard to perfectly match up though, and you didn't ask for the second one. My solution is to use some simple css and a free photo editor. (You dont have to do any photo editing, I have the image). I took the colors from the top and bottom of the original image and then set a css gradient. background-image: linear-gradient(#F4DAE2, #EED5DC, #EED1D8); Super easy! Then you just set your body's min-height property to 100vh so nothing repeats. We use paint.net or photoshop to erase the edges of the image in a gradient pattern. Anyone can do this. 

You can get the gradient image file from https://i.ibb.co/0BbJ6bb/face.png. We put that image in the center of the page and everything blends nicely! It's been almost a year so please mark this answer or another as the solution to close the question. Thank you!

There are a few ways to do this.
You can set the image as background on the body, or on a wrapper div, and use background-size property to cover.
Or, you can create a stand-alone div at the top of your code, make it position:fixed;top:0;left:0;width:100vw;height:100vh; (sets the image to full size of the viewport) and z-index:-1 (places it beneath the other divs). This is a nice effect because you can also add opacity:0.5 or some such to ""dim"" the image a little bit, and the rest of your webpage overlays the image.

The color of your background is solid, but the Image you have selected has a very slight gradient. To see this, Look at the top and bottom of the image to see this. The image is lighter than your background on top, and darker on the bottom of the screen.

You could fix this using gradients, but that would require a fair bit of trial and error.

Download your firebase service account into your project and reference it like this:
<code>
  var admin = require(""firebase-admin"");
  var serviceAccount = require(""path/to/serviceAccountKey.json"");

  admin.initializeApp({
    credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
    databaseURL: ""<database-url>""
  });
</code>

"

I had same problem in firebase Error: ""Could not get default credentials.""
Then go to firebase console and go to project setting, where you can find Service Accounts option. Click there and you will see the Generate new private key under your project setting. 
Copy code for your project language and add it to your project file.


var admin = require(""firebase-admin"");

var serviceAccount = require(""path/to/serviceAccountKey.json"");

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
  databaseURL: ""https://your-database-url-that-is-given-under-admin-sdk-snippets""

After Generating the key you will have option to download. and put it in the project folder. Also set path var serviceAccount = require(""path/to/serviceAccountKey.json"");

That's it your are ready.

I had the same error ""Could not load the default credentials"".
The error occured after updating my project dependencies with npm update.
More precisely firebase-admin and firebase-functions.
Before update:
""dependencies"": {
    ""@google-cloud/firestore"": ""^1.3.0"",
    ""firebase-admin"": ""~7.0.0"",
    ""firebase-functions"": ""^2.2.0""
}

After update:
""dependencies"": {
    ""@google-cloud/firestore"": ""^1.3.0"",
    ""firebase-admin"": ""^8.6.0"",
    ""firebase-functions"": ""^3.3.0""
}

I added the serviceAccountKey.json to my project and changed the imports with the code provided at the service account setting of my firebase project.
From :
var admin = require('firebase-admin')

admin.initializeApp()

To:
var admin = require('firebase-admin');    
var serviceAccount = require('path/to/serviceAccountKey.json');

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
  databaseURL: 'https://my-project.firebaseio.com'
});

I do not want to use @Fernando solution even though there is nothing wrong. 
I have prd and non-prd environment. I use firebase use command to push the changes to the correct environment. When I deploy, firebase uses the default service account. Also I do not want to have the keys in the project folder or in my git repo. 
The way I solved might not work for others, but want to share here.
The issue came to me when I updated the permission of the firebase project to give a viewer with editor permission. I made that person the owner and rolled back to editor. It went away. It is not justifying as a fix, but worked for me and I do not have to download the key.

104,58127896,58828202,answer,"
@aldobaie's answer helped me figure out what was going on for my use case. For those who are not looking to add async/await to all their calls, remember that the firestore calls return promises, so prepending them with return has the same effect. 
In my case:
function doSomething(...) {
    return admin.firestore().collection(...).doc(...).get()
        .then((doc) => {...})
        .catch(err => {...})
}

module.exports = functions.firestore.document('collection/{docId}').onWrite((change, context) => {
    return doSomething()
})

I think the accepted answer goes against Firebase's recommend configuration. The function environment has access to admin credentials already, and passing your key in the code is not recommended. 
I do it like this:
const functions = require('firebase-functions')
const admin = require('firebase-admin')
admin.initializeApp(functions.config().firebase)

"
105,58127896,58779000,answer,"
I ran into the same problem myself. Sometimes the function works and many times it would through the Error: Could not load the default credentials error.
The problem I believe have been solved by watching for the Callbacks. You have to keep the function running until the callbacks have been called using the await and async prefixes. 
Firebase Cloud Functions don't allow the access to the processor through callbacks once it's been terminated! That's why we get the Error: Could not load the default credentials error.
So, whenever you have a .then() function prefix it with await and prefix the function it's inside it with async and prefix any call to the function with await.
async function registerUser(..) {
    ...
    await admin.firestore().collection(..)...
    ...
}

I hope this helps you out!

Another option is to set the service account key in an environmental variable instead of setting it with a call to firebaseAdmin.initializeApp({ credential }).
Linux
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=""[PATH]""
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=""/home/user/Downloads/[FILE_NAME].json""

Windows PowerShell
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=""[PATH]""

model.add(Dense(32, input_dim=784))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(LSTM(17))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(loss=tensorflow.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy, optimizer=tensorflow.keras.optimizers.Adam(), metrics=['accuracy'])

So not sure if this helps but obviously I have the same errors and even the newest ios update does not solve it.
Today I was designing the interface on mac before pushing it to the ios environment and I noticed the web previewer also gives a lot of error messages being 
Failed to load resource: unsupported URL  -> coming from gap://ready
I have the feeling this is because of url blocking on local pages, stuff like that. Can this all be caused by some security update on webview which just mangles up the cordova init?

No error on macOS doing exactly the same thing.
Tried different URLs, with no difference.
  import UIKit
  import WebKit

  class ViewController: UIViewController {

  @IBOutlet weak var webView: WKWebView!


  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

        let url = URL (string: ""https://discussions.apple.com/welcome"")
        let requestObj = URLRequest(url: url!)
        webView.load(requestObj)


   }

The iOS bug with WKWebView is not solved yet, even with iOS 13.3 (at the time of writing this answer). Nonetheless, no issue is not seen on UIWebView. 
For Ionic developers, Ionic supports two webviews for a few years now (UIWebView and WKWebView). Since Ionic V3, WKWebview is used by default when building for iOS. Ionic documentation favours WKWebview as the the best option for any app, as it features many improvements over the legacy UIWebView. 
Till fixing this iOS bug, you can force using UIWebView in Ionic apps by adding the following preference line to the config.xml under the tag widget and not platform. 
<preference name=""CordovaWebViewEngine"" value=""CDVUIWebViewEngine"" />

This basically forces Ionic to use CDVUIWebViewEngine which is not impacted by the bug.

I will pre-admit this is a terrible ""answer"" but it is a valid observation.  This has something to do with sandboxing.  If you rebuild your app without a sandbox, there are no messages.  If you turn on the sandbox and enable Outgoing Connections which is all I need for my app, every mouse event in the webkit gives me the unhappy message. 
If I also include Incoming Connections, just as a test, same messages.
Remove the sandbox (for an internal use only app), no stupid messages.  Perhaps this observation will help someone at Apple track this problem down some more.

I don't really know why this affects it, but hey ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
I am using Firebase - and here was a line in my Podfile:
pod 'Firebase/DynamicLinks'

After removing that, I no longer got these logs. Strange, but it works I guess if you don't yet need this pod for now.
This may also be an issue for other pods, who knows.
I have that line in my Podfile for a feature I am yet to implement, but can't until I get a full Apple Developer Membership account.

It's a bug in WebKit (or the underlying OS itself).
And no, it was not fixed in 13.[2,3] release.

As in the accepted answer, this is a WebKit bug and it seems that it has been fixed but not released up until the latest iOS release 13.2.2 (at the time of writing this answer).
As a workaround, however, you can disable/hide the logs temporarily as mentioned in an answer by @iDevzilla:
1- From Xcode menu open: Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme
2- On your Environment Variables set OS_ACTIVITY_MODE = disable

This will ONLY hide the logs so you can continue developing and testing on iOS. As some indicated, this problem crashes their apps no matter what (for me it is not until now). Also, be careful using this method as it might hide important error messages!
