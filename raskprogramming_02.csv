The accuracy isn't important for my layperson use case, so automated translation is fine. Currently I have my eyes on Googles translation service, since its quality is right where I need it and the python API works well.

It's around 22k lines, with around 650k characters. If I target 6 languages, it comes around to requesting translations of around 4 million.

With Google services, the pricing is defined as `$20 per 1,000,000 characters`, so this would cost me around 80$. That's inside the 300$ free credit you get on google cloud services, so that's very nice.

But I don't know if that's a good approach. Do any of you have experience with translation services and could help me out? I'm processing the translation data from a python script, so something with a python API would be ideal, but if there's a good alternative I'm sure I could work around that too.

9,afjvho,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/afjvho/what_adaptions_does_your_company_make_to_scrum_to/,What adaptions does your company make to Scrum to maximize efficiency?,"Hi, I work in a company with &gt;100 employees and our management wants to use the [LeSS methodology](https://less.works/less/framework/index.html). I actually think this is not going to solve our problems, so I'm currently researching ways to improve our company's development methodology. There are a few ways in which I think Scrum is becoming outdated, or where it doesn't account for everything in software development. Some examples: 

- In my experience, most Scrum teams have a difficult time handling technical user stories and bugs, because they don't fit the sprint goal.
- A lot of companies seem to have multiple projects per Scrum team. This makes it harder to define a team-wide sprint goal, because members of the team are working on different functionality. Also, sprint planning seems inefficient because members of the team help planning issues that they won't even work on.
- Right now our Scrum teams seem to operate within their own bubble. Code is owned by a team and knowledge stays within that team. Often features etc are implemented redundantly and teams have no clue about the features that other teams are building.
- Sprints are synchronous, where issues often have a very asynchronous nature. For example: sometimes your issue has a dependency to a change to some third party library. You can't estimate how long it will take for the library to pick up your issue and to release the change you need. Also, sometimes during the sprint you will find out that some functionality requires a major refactor, or that you estimation is way off because your easy way of fixing it was impossible. Cramming these kinds of issues into a fixed time-box seems to mess up your sprint a lot.

I have way more examples, but I'm planning on writing a Medium article, so I don't want to spoil everything yet. I encountered a lot of articles and videos that seem to share the opinion that Scrum has been a major revolution, but that it's becoming outdated. I wanted to ask you guys a couple of questions about Scrum within your company.

1. What are the biggest advantages of Scrum?
2. Which adaptions did you make to make Scrum more efficient within your company?
3. Do you work on multiple projects in the same Scrum teams? How do you handle this?
4. What are the biggest reasons of estimations being off?
5. Do you define sprint goals? Do you often fail to reach your sprint goal because you carry stories to the next sprint?
6. How do you handle support issues, bugs and technical stories?
7. Which inefficiencies do you see during the Scrum processes?

Again, I'm not trying to bash on Scrum (that seems to be the trend). I think Scrum has some major advantages to other software methodologies. That said, I think software development has outgrown Scrum and it is time for another revolution.

13,aflok2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/aflok2/event_driven_architecture_for_a_wpf_net_app/,Event driven architecture for a WPF .NET app,"Hi,


I'm currently developing a WPF .NET app (running code-first EF) and have a question regarding best practices when it comes to event handling and propagation in applications such as this. I'm a lead devops guy by trade, but haven't done much .NET so I'm not that good with best practices in this framework.

So, a typical ""flow of control"" in my app is roughly something like this:

     Main app window -&gt; Multiple custom user controls -&gt; Button that 
     opens dialog window -&gt; Dialog window -&gt; WPF controls

Let's say I have a user control (not the one listed in the flow of control) in the main app window that lists users of the system and their details. Let's also say that the final dialog window in the flow of control above contains controls that edit user data. So that when I exit that dialog, data will have changed in the main window user control and this will need to be reloaded.


What are the best practices for event propagation from the dialog, back to the owning user control, up to the main window and then back into the user control that holds a grid with user data?


In my current solution I have a custom routed event with an enum that I set in the event as the action that happened. In the above example this would mean that the final dialog would raise an ActionEvent with an enum value of USER_SAVED, which would then be propagated trough handle-&gt;re-raise up to the main app window, which would then call a function UpdateDataFromDatabase() on the user control with the user data grid. The main problem with this approach as I see it that I get sort of a ""superevent"" that will be used all over the app and will probably grow to be pretty big. Is there a better approach?

Make a program in Python that lights LEDs based on CPU temperature

GREEN = CPU TEMP &lt;40

GREEN + YELLOW = 40&lt;CPU TEMP&lt;50

GREEN + YELLOW + RED = 50 &lt; CPU TEMP

&amp;#x200B;

So far I only have code that measures CPU temp once/second, I intend on starting from there:

&gt;import os  
&gt;  
&gt;import time  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;def measure\_temp():  
&gt;  
&gt;	temp = os.popen(""vcgencmd measure\_temp"").readline()  
&gt;  
&gt;	return (temp.replace(""temp="",""""))

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;while True:  
&gt;  
&gt;	print(measure\_temp())  
&gt;  
&gt;	time.sleep(1)

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a few different codes that turn LEDs ON/OFF, make them BLINK once/sec, and that turn the LEDs on WHILST I press a button on my breadboard. So I guess, similarly to the button code (If no activity from button, do nothing, else, turn on) I would need the code to say something like '

Let CPU Temp = x

If x &lt; 40 deg C, then light up LED A; If = 40&lt;x&lt;50, then turn on LED A + LED B etc....""

I don't know if that is a correct theoretical approach to the problem? I'm very new to thinking like a programmer and only have very basic knowledge. For now all I can do is think of how to approach the problem in English, and then translate that into python once I know how I'm going to tackle the problem.

I am using my raspberry pi for this. So far I've used Python 2 IDLE, which is great, except it's not ideal for editing code once I've already executed it.  Alternatively I have tried creating a .py file, opening it in Python (V2.7), and simply hitting ""Run module"" which opens a new shell and runs the script within that new window, whilst leaving the code in the original intact and fully editable, but this still isn't ideal. I have notice that Thonny Python IDE is pretty much what I'm looking for as it splits the screen into two portions: the code I write on top, and the 'run' portion below, BUT this only works with Python 3 and above.

Does anyone know of a Python 2 IDE I can get that will allow me to code short scripts, run them, see the result, then edit and run again?

We use [Loki](https://github.com/oblador/loki) for that. Basically, we compare screenshots of UI components with the previous version.  This requires us to keep screenshots of the previous version under source control.

This works well until two developers change the same code.

1. Developer A merges his code to master.
2. Developer B makes a pull request. The PR has conflicts with master, because both update the same screenshots.
3. Developer B needs to update his branch and regenerate the screenshots. This can monopolise his CPU for a few minutes.
4. Developer B pushes the updated pull request. The tests can take another 5-10 minutes.

Is there a way we can avoid this painful process? When you have many pull requests to merge, it can get really tedious!",0,1,2019-01-22 08:46:30

An issue I'm having is just understanding the structures and the purpose of their components.

Unfortunately throwing Doxygen blindly at this very non-Doxygen documented code has not worked. For example, the following code segment defining a struct:

     /*--------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Subregion:
     *   Structure describing an index-space cartesian region.
     *--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
    
    typedef struct {
      int ix, iy, iz;        /* Bottom-lower-left corner in index-space */
      int nx, ny, nz;        /* Size */
      int sx, sy, sz;        /* Striding factors */
      int rx, ry, rz;        /* Refinement over the background grid */
      int level;             /* Refinement level = rx + ry + rz */
    
      int process;           /* Process containing this subgrid */
    } Subregion;

The resulting Doxygen documentation has none of this, just the symbol names and types.

I know that a lot of answers to this will be ""JuSt ReAd ThE cOdE"", but when there are hundreds of thousands of lines of text, searching for these types, especially when there are 3-4 layers of typedefs between them and an object oriented design using macros and locally defined, commonly named structs^(\*\*), just finding where these are defined can be difficult.

This is why Doxygen is useful. However, Doxygen doesn't work on this code, unfortunately. One of my first thoughts was that I could regex my may way to something Doxygen like, but it went poorly. I've also tried [Sourcetrail](https://www.sourcetrail.com/), but it also has issues with this complicated codebase. Are there documentation tools (like Doxygen) or code exploration tools (like Sourcetrail) that can derive documentation from loosely-structured but contextually obvious comments like this?

\* This application was developed before C++ binaries were fast enough for their needs, so they wrote it in C with lots of macros to give a OOP-like experience. It's clever, but painful to work in.

\*\* Each .c file (never a .h) can have a Public and Instance struct defined in it, which is used locally to emulate static class and class instance data. However, all .c files use the same name for these structs (Public and Instance), which causes search hell, and really knocks both Doxygen and Sourcetrail on the head.",1,1,2019-01-22 12:51:14
36,aiponm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/aiponm/efficiently_update_images_in_android_activity/,Efficiently update images in Android activity with handler while UDP socket AsyncTask runs in the background,"I have an Android application that updates images based on decoded GDL90 commands sent through UDP. However the Memory and CPU usage is too large for many devices, and even on better devices the application will freeze up after about 20 minutes of running.

First in an AsyncTask UDP Packets are received. These are decoded and appropriate messages are sent to the handler in the activity. The handler then updates the images, rotating some and moving others by an amount sent in the handler messages.

One reason this is not efficient is because these images are updated regardless of whether the new packets have changed values, i.e if the rotation was 23.4 before and a new packet comes in set to 23.4 the handler still updates the screen and uses memory. Is this conventional when showing real time responses over UDP or is this just clumsy design?

On devices like my phone, a lower end Samsung device, the memory usage is so large that most packets are lost. Other devices run great until the memory usage boils over to a point where not even a single packet will be received.

One solution I have found is to refresh the Activity every x seconds with an Intent. This seems to trigger the garbage collector more frequently and help handle memory more efficiently. However my boss does not think this an adequate solution as it causes the device to disconnect from the UDP socket and looks clunky.

I've also tried using Glide to handle the images more efficiently but this had an adverse effect.

Does anyone have any idea about a different approach I could take? Even just general thoughts on Memory management would be appreciated. Is there any precedent for similar applications that have to update images constantly from a handler while a UDP socket is connected in the background?",0,1,2019-01-22 13:19:05

Why?,"I am seeing this pattern a lot while reviewing my colleagues code and I cannot understand why they are doing this. When I ask they do not have an answer other than ""it's good to be explicit"". 

I agree. I think this is an unnecessary level of verbosity even taking into account PHP and type juggling. I don't believe there is a code readability argument here either.

        // I have seen both examples
        $fizz = ($foo &amp;&amp; $bar) ? true : false;

        if ($foo &amp;&amp; $bar) {
            $buzz = true;
        } else {
            $buzz = false;
        }

        // Why not?
        $bang = ($foo &amp;&amp; $bar);

Even assuming there is a concern with the data types of $foo and $bar that is never going to change the fact that the evaluation of these two variables as such will always return a boolean.


Ironically the same person will then do this:

    if ($foo === 4) { do_thing(); }

What is 4? What does that represent? Is $foo going to be a string or an int? Could it be anything but an integer, a boolean? Are you okay if $foo is a string '4' or an integer 4? Better make sure $foo is the correct type because of that ===. 

I have to take their argument about being explicit with a grain of salt when they follow up with this.


So am I stupid and not seeing the obvious regarding the boolean?

&amp;#x200B;

1) When I compile and run this class, it never terminates. Why is this?  

2) When startRegistry() gets run, it fails and so the catch is run. A Registry object is created. Once the function is done running, doesn't Registry not exist anymore because its scope is limited to the function call? There's nothing in the main method that directly stores a registry either. Does it exist behind the scenes somewhere? It seems odd to declare an object that doesn't appear to get used just before the end of the function call. Can someone shed some light on what's happening here?

The database is up to about 150 tables normalized for their various functions and works great. Unfortunately the previous devs did not utilize any framework like Zend or Symfony so the the Access Control Lists are implemented in SQL queries. The application level permissions were effectively implemented with Role-Based Access Control and work fine, but the Object-level access control lists from the database requires a bunch of joins for every query I'm running for my dashboard.

There are basically three levels of object level permissions (top level objects are ""contacts"").

* User is part of a group that has access to the contact and is an admin.
* User owns the contact.
* User has been individually granted access to the contact.

So currently the Contact, ContactGroups, and ContactUserAccess tables all have to be joined if I want a list of Documents, or if I want a list of addresses, or if I want a list of X I always have to get back to all those tables to make sure that person can see the totals for themselves. This creates a lot of logic in every SQL query.

I thought about storing contactIds in session so I could just run the queries and compare arrays to make sure the Id is in there, but I still have to update it each query because permissions change often enough and the query into PHP could theoretically return a result set too large for memory and take FOREVER to compare.

For words beginning with a vowel, add ""way"" to the end.

If the first consonants include ""qu"", move the ""u"" along with the ""q"". Don't forget about words like ""squeal"" where ""qu"" doesn't come first!

For words beginning with ""y"", treat ""y"" as a consonant.

My idea is to create a function that splits the user input into an array of strings, then analyzes each index of the array's element so that I can apply the appropriate conditions to words that start w/ vowels, start with constanants, etc. I wanted to build a for loop that does this so that I can base all of the logic off of one loop. However, my current iteration of the code isn't working and I'm lost as to why. I've designated an empty string to add the elements to, and it is adding an iteration of each element for how many index position each element has.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an idea for a web-business in a specific niche; the features would be relatively straight forward, wouldn't require any new or proprietary type features  I don't think. Basically it just needs to be a searchable database for users, where back end users can upload their listing and potential customers can search for their listing. Simple. Here are examples of similar types of sites:

&amp;#x200B;

The basis for this site would be really simple; there is only one type of thing users would be posting or searching. What I'm wondering is; is this type of site something a completely code-illiterate non-tech person could build using WP and plug-ins? (and if so, does anyone know what specific plug-ins those would be)? Or is this something that would have to be built totally from scratch? I'd like to build this thing myself if possible, as I don't really have money to spend on it. If my only option is to hire a dev, how much would something like this typically cost?

&amp;#x200B;

Something to note also: The users searching for the posts wouldn't actually be purchasing anything from my site; rather they'd be directed to a weblink on a different, commonly used website where they could then make their ""purchase"". My site is more or less acting as a broker to help a specific niche user-group sort and find listings for a thing that can be found and purchased someplace else.

I'm having some weird issues getting a simple low-level file transfer in Python 2 work in Python 3. I basically have a simple server/client setup. The user, working on a prompt produced by the server, requests a file to be transferred to his machine from the client (this is a reverse shell setup, so the connection is initiated from the client machine and the server machine is sending commands to the client). It works without a hitch in Python 2, but I just cannot get it to work with seemingly equivalent Python 3 code. Here's the relevant functions:

Python 2 Server:

        else: # the file doesn't exist
            s.send('Unable to find the file')

And here's what I've got in Python 3:

Python 3 Server:

I'm mostly thinking of the digital versions. Often there's a DRM-protected version 1:1 of the book and you need eg. a personal Adobe-account to get the book onto your reader of choice. In that case I think it's very clear that the use case of creating a ""corporate"" adobe-account and sharing the book for a complete team is breaking the ToS. But I just bought the physical copy of the new edition of Fowler's Refactoring and a big part of that is that the ""web edition"" is the canonical version. But there's the same wording in the ToS for getting access to the Web version ""personal"" and ""non-commercial"". Is the idea that you should buy a personal copy for each developer and then throw the book out (figuratively) when the developer quits?

I don't know maybe buying physical copies in the first place and letting interested developer take them home if they are interested in reading them is equally problematic in legal terms?

A user client (not staff) needs to create an account via web form to get a demo or purchase a product on an e-commerce website. Those are done in 2 separate websites. 

&amp;nbsp;

When the client user (not staff) creates an account via web form we ask for personal fields such as name, address. Currently, the email address is being used as the unique primary key to identify an account via SSO. Accounts can have others account linked to (a team account with multiple people under one admin).

Example from the store: 

&amp;nbsp;
https://i.stack.imgur.com/dE3yT.png
&amp;nbsp;


Question: how to minimize company field duplication in my database when client user is submitting company information via web form? As an example, the user can type: Wald Disney, Wald Disney Company, Wald Disney Company Inc, Walddi Disney, Disney Company when purchasing the product. That will result in multiple company entries that are in fact the same company.

&amp;nbsp;

These are the current methods being tried:


&amp;nbsp;

1-Same email address cannot be used in multiple accts. We use an SSO with email sign as a primary key to manage identity in multiple platforms. Restrict company owner as one per company.

&amp;nbsp;

2-I currently ask for Company Name, but this is not enough and we already have duplication. Another option is to provide a drop-down list with search, so all existing records of companies that exist in the database are displayed as drop-down which forces the user to see the existing options before submitting new records. Like in this form: https://www.contentful.com/contact/sales/

&amp;nbsp;

Note: the user can still ignore the dropdown and make a new entry.

  https://i.stack.imgur.com/If2QX.png

3-Ask for company website address. So I can identify company by using part of the string as unique identifier for company.


&amp;nbsp;

note: a lot of clients do not have their own company website but do have social media. Most companies are group of freelancers. It's unlikely that they will provide social media. I'm not sure if this will be redundant with the company website link.

&amp;nbsp;


4-My erp admin will have to accept new company entries manually on the admin portal as a task.

Are there any other methods to prevent this type of duplication?",2,1,2019-01-07 13:55:04

I've been posed with a challenge at work - my team spends hundreds of hours annually pulling Excel files from my company's Oracle tool: [Agile Produce Lifecycle Management](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/agile/product-lifecycle-management-process/product-data-management-process/overview/index.html)

My manager has asked me to automate this process. Our technical teams at my company are unable to get these files for us directly.

I got a minor in computer science but I haven't programmed anything in a few years.

I have been googling this, and I have made a simple scraper in Python using BeautifulSoup4 that can download files, but it relies on the fact that the URLs of the pages I'm pulling from are predictable.

The pages I'm using are interactive. They all end in '.aspx' and they have URL parameters (I think that's the right word) that tells the web app where to go. These parameters seem to be generated as I move around the site; I think the URL I see when I'm on a particular project page changes whenever I start a new session with the site.

**I'm certainly not asking anyone to do my job for me, but I would sincerely appreciate some leads.**

2. What tools or programming language should I learn to accomplish this?
3. Where can I go to learn how to do this?",4,5,2019-01-07 15:57:32

Now I switch over to mac, and I get this error using Atom:

`OSError: unable to read font file '28DaysLater.ttf'`

So my first thought is mac is stupid, but then I open the exact same thing in IDLE, and it once again runs perfectly fine. So I'm thinking there is a problem with the path in atom somehow, but I don't know what it would be. Is there a way to maybe specify the path of the py file that is running (the font is in the same folder as the file by the way)?

Using atom-python-run package in atom.

Edit: Figured it out. Had to specify the path for some reason which is a bit annoying but I guess would be fine in the end.

Basically you start the program, it asks you to enter a number, then an operator (\*,-,+,/) and your second number. I'm sticking to Integers for the time being. My problem is, whenever I run my code, let's say with ""1 + 5"" I get 0 as my result. Like I said I'm new to Java and would appreciate if someone could check out my code.

    	static String oper;
    	static int result;
    	
    	// END VARIABLES
    
    	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		
    		System.out.println(""Enter a number: "");
    		num1 = reader.nextInt();

    		System.out.println(""Enter an operator (/, *, -, +): "");
    		oper = reader.next();
    		System.out.println("""");
    
    		System.out.println(""Enter your 2nd number: "");
    		System.out.println("""");
    		num2 = reader.nextInt();
    		
    		System.out.println(eval(num1, num2));
    		
    	}
    
    	private static int eval(int num1, int num2) {
    		
    		if (oper == ""+"") {
    			result = num1 + num2;
    		}
    		
    		if (oper == ""-"") {
    			result = num1 - num2;

1. The first problem is an outputting problem. At the very end, I ask the user if they'd like to restart the program. If I input Y, it goes down the Y if statement. However, when I input N, the cout statement in the if Y statement triggers. Why is that?
2. The second problem is that I'm not sure how to restart the loop/the whole program. I thought if I reset the loop parameters back to the original value (stop = false), it would make the loop start again. However, that is not the case, and it just ends the program after I input something.

In my `public_html` folder, I have two folders. One is called `main`, and the other is called `report`.

When somebody navigates to `example.com`, I want to serve content from the `main` folder, but I want their URL to remain the same.

So, if they navigate to `example.com/file.html`, I want them to see the `file.html` file that's in the `main` folder, but I **don't** want their URL to change to `example.com/main/file.html`.

Similarly, if they navigate to `report.example.com/report1.pdf`, I want them to see the `report1.pdf` file that's in the `report` folder, but I **don't** want their URL to change to `report.example.com/report/report1.pdf`.

The closest thing I've been able to achieve is this:

    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.htm
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteBase /
    
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^example.com$ [NC]
    RewriteRule ^((?!main).*)$ /main/$1
    
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^report.example.com$ [NC]
    RewriteRule ^((?!report).*)$ /report/$1 [L]

That seems to work to some extent, but:

* If somebody navigates to `http://example.com/report/index.html`, the server incorrectly loads the `index.html` file from the `public_html/report` folder rather than the `public_html/main/report` folder. Normally that path would make sense, but in this case I'm trying to change that behavior.

* If somebody navigates to `http://report.example.com/test`, the server correctly displays the `public_html/test/index.html` file, but redirects them to `http://report.example.com/report/test/`.

I am a primary school teacher in desperate need of help. A coworker of mine has called on a favor and I need to help him create a password guessing game of sorts. What we would like to do is put an app (I'm assuming I could write this in JS) that is on an interactive white board that has a simple interface with a 4-6 digit password that can be typed in and guessed. We think the best way would be to have the teacher be able to write the password the same way you would on a computer or phone without being able to see the characters being written. Then onces it is set, students cant come up to the board and press on drop boxes with numbers 0-9 and try to guess the password. It's probably better if they can guess the 6 numbers all at once and then press a button and then see red or green lights if each number was guessed correctly or not. The interface can be simple as long as that it is clean. My coworker said that he will have it up in class and parents may see it.

I am not looking for someone to straight up do this for me, as I wouldn't mind using this as a learning experience for myself and my class. What I need rather, is for someone to point me in the right direction with some instructions if that's possible. However if someone wanted to do it AND provide instructions I would obviously be happy with that as well, but that's asking too much. I have some experience coding in JS and Python, so either is fine, however I have never used Python outside of an online IDE. My coworker will use it in class, but I will try and walk my year 4-5 students through it (if I can get it myself). I know how to teach the concepts in coding, however my own recently experience is... lacking.

If someone knows of a website or an app that does what I'm looking for that would be lovely as well, however I still wouldn't mind some advise on how to start this on my own. I would give it a go without the help but I'm at a bit of a loss for time as school just got back in and I'm up to my neck in preparation for test week.

I am a recent graduate in Computer Science and have been brought on by a company to create an API for our system to connect clients with ERP Systems. We are a small startup with only a few developers so it is challenging to create everything in house. I've been doing some research trying to figure out the best way to approach this project. Our new version is currently being developed with a lot of features from AWS, so naturally I looked towards using AWS API Gateway since everything would probably play nice. However, a coworker brought up using third party software to help with developing our API to reduce cost and prevent recreating the wheel. When looking up software that can help design and manage API creation, I am mostly seeing companies like Apigee and Mulesoft.

&amp;#x200B;

for example I have a method which looks like this (it's just an example, which returns the amount of divisions needed):

    class Calc {
        static getDivisionCountByTwo(num) {
            let quotient = num;
            let iterations = 0;
        
        do {
            quotient = Math.trunc(quotient / 2);
            iterations ++;
        } while (quotient !== 0);
        
        return iterations;
        }
    }

&amp;#x200B;

So far I only used it to get the division count, e.g.:

    console.log(Calc.getDivisionCountByTwo(4)); // returns 3
    console.log(Calc.getDivisionCountByTwo(6)); // returns 3
    console.log(Calc.getDivisionCountByTwo(8)); // returns 4

&amp;#x200B;

So far so good. Now I would like to return each `quotient` as an array. How would I do this, assuming I would like the method to do what its name says? I could return an object, which would hold all the information I need, but it wouldn't be something you would expect to get returned from a method named `getDivisionCountByTwo`

&amp;#x200B;

Or, to keep it more abstarct: I have a working method where I would like to access 'internal' data. How could I do this, without modifying the method? How would you approach this and why?",1,1,2019-01-15 07:03:03

Hi guys, Ill try to keep this short.

I'm an intern at a small WebDev company, I've been tasked with making a website for a lawyer. The attorney wants his clients to be able to send him an emergency contact form from his website. I have the form made and used the [mailto:](mailto:example@gmail.com)attribute in html to send the email. It seems to work when tested on my own email.

He also wants to be able to get a notification on his phone of when an emergency email comes through from the web server. The issue is he wants one email, but he doesn't want notifications of non emergency emails, only ones from the form on his website.

I was hoping someone could just point me in the right direction for a solution to this. One of my ideas is a small Android app that syncs to his gmail and pings his phone anytime it detects a form being sent from the web server?

Or maybe there is a simpler solution to this? (php script?). I just started this internship and its definitely trial by fire so any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

I programmed on my phone for the better part of my studies and found it quite convenient. Now, a few years older (and wiser), I'd like to dust off my skills. 
I have just bought a Chinese XBox controller replica. I would like to use it in Visual Studio so that I can use it for programming (mostly C++ apps).  

Unfortunately, it seems that the text editor does not really support anything other than keyboards, really.

I am looking for an interface, so that I can easily write text with my controller. Something like the ""spinning wheel"" on those old iPod's would be perfect, I guess. 

Any ideas?",25,1,2019-01-26 11:15:07

I am a software developer, and I am contracting for a large bank. Basically I've been hired to join a project. So it has been 3 weeks to my shock the code base is absolutely horrible. I am mainly working on UI fixes and minor bugs until I learn about the code base. This code is the worst I have ever seen, and worst I've ever had to work with. I literally get frustrated at how it was implemented and now it feels too late to even bring value to the project. I've been lied to by the agency who never told me this was an end of life project that I am joining. The project is carried out by an off-shore development team who has been bought in house (not to mention names but you know what I mean). 

&amp;#x200B;

To keep this short, at the end of the day I am a contractor and I leave without too much hassle.

&amp;#x200B;

 Should I keep working and just improve the code for the next developers and for the customers of this bank? which for me  feels like the right thing to do.  I am not sure if this is my opinion or the lead developer just guilt tripping into not leaving. 

&amp;#x200B;

However I don't feel it is not fair that I have to stress about how to fix some random UI bugs with position absolute used everywhere and I have to restructure the whole page to be responsive and god-knows if it would break other pages. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I walk or should I stay? What has been your experience in such environment ?

I'm a web developer and I've always wanted to get into game development as a hobby. However, I want to avoid the problem of not having people to actually play the finished product. I have an idea as to why this happens. 

Far too often I see game ideas that are just impractical for the number of people and budget for the project. Like nobody is going to want to play your budget MMORPG when there is WoW, ESO, etc. And nobody is going to want to play your budget 3D looter shooter when there is Destiny, The Division, etc. AAA studios have the money and resources to make a game that will always be better in these categories. In my opinion, there are some game types/genres that don't work for solo/small dev teams. 

However, I do think there are some types of games that do work well for small setups. For example, I think something like a [clicker games](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html) are something that is actually practical for one developer with a tiny budget to make. [Agar.io](https://agar.io/) is another example that comes to mind. There's barely graphics, little AAA competition, etc. I think these are good qualities for a viable solo dev game to have.

The obvious choices would probably be some side-scroller or top-down RPG. But I feel like those are so common for indie game development that the market is incredibly saturated already.

So what other types of games are good for a solo developer in 2019? ",0,0,2019-01-26 12:45:21

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a AP Comp Sci Principals class in high school, and I need to write a program for the AP Test. Since the test is in python, I'm learning/writing it in python, and using Pycharm as the IDE. Initially, i installed Pycharm on my USB, along with Python. When I program off my USB at home, everything works fine. But when I plug said USB into the laptops we have in the classroom, I'm greeted with Pycharm not letting me run the program because the interpreter is ""invalid."" Even though the Python interpreter I was using is on the USB. I try it again at home, and it works fine.

&amp;#x200B;

So after some research on the issue, i decided the best way (to my knowledge) was to turn my 16GB USB into a persistent USB using Linux Ubuntu, so that I could have python on the OS ,and hopefully run the python interpreter and Pycharm fine. The issue with that is that the Ubuntu loads up fine, but its not persistent, and i loose everything i changed when i reboot the computer. I spent 8 hours yesterday when I got home from school trying different methods, but nothing works. I've pretty much given up on this method.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm attack this issue from the wrong direction? Does anyone know another way I could solve my issue, or maybe whats causing it?
