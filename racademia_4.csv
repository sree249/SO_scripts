I've recently become interested in the interdisciplinary area of computational social science, including the work currently being done at Stanford's [Center for Computational Social Sciences](https://iriss.stanford.edu/css).

For anyone that's pursued an interdisciplinary field (especially in social sciences), what did your path look like? Any general advice you could offer to a grad student? I'm currently wrapping up my master's, which will prepare me to be a university administrator. The area that I'm currently interested includes institutional research, the research side of enrollment management, and so on. I'll probably work as an administrator for several years before pursing doctoral studies (pretty much a norm for most education fields, from what I can tell).

It's been really cool to read about some of the way that folks have used computational tools in political science, sociology, etc., and I think that there's a lot of potential in education studies as well! The closest I've been able to come is the field of quantitative psychology, which is more stats-focused.",2,9

15,bctt88,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/bctt88/clinical_phd_student_looking_to_apply_to/,Clinical PhD student looking to apply to different programs. Really need some advice.,"Hello all! I’m a 2nd year clinical psychology PhD student and I have had quite a rocky start toward completing my degree. This will take a lot of explaining but I would appreciate it if you bear with me.

I graduated with my BA in psychology in May of 2017 and immediately enrolled in a clinical PhD program the following fall (2017). I chose this program for financial reasons as well as the fact that my mentor was/is a perfect personality match. Things were great first semester, as I completed 4 classes with straight As and was in good standing with my assistantship and research responsibilities.

Then second semester hit. My assistantship supervisor had to have surgery which put her out of commission for 2 months. During this time, the program director took over as my assistantship supervisor and my job expectations changed, as I was instructed to create multiple materials (e.g., surveys, workbooks) for an upcoming seminar where ~60 people were expected to attend. Now, my new supervisor is a notorious micromanager and has a reputation of projecting her anxiety on a multitude of students. I was no exception. I was constantly criticized for my “lack of professionalism,” as I wouldn’t provide her with updates on pretty much a daily basis. In hindsight, I definitely was not as organized as I am now, and I recognize that. That being said, the micromanaging only served to exacerbate the situation and was counterproductive. This was also my first semester of practicum, which is the other source of my troubles. My practicum supervisor was friendly and we had great rapport. However, come time for mid semester evaluation, I was blindsided by many of her ratings. The combination of criticism from the program director (my substitute GA supervisor) and my practicum supervisor resulted in the establishment of a remediation plan, which lasted a full year. And I completed it, and was restored to good standing in the program this past January. I thought I was out of the woods. I was wrong. 

Two months later, it came time to interview for a therapy practicum placement after I had been excelling at my current assessment practicum site. This is a position I had interviewed for last year (before I was made aware of my remediation) and I was actually offered the position, but had to decline. I went into this interview already familiar with who I was speaking with. I thought it went really well (again). Apparently, it did not. I was “effusive” according to my interviewer. Granted, I am a very expressive and talkative person. I guess I came across as unprofessional as a result of this. I was also not selected for a new GA position that I had interviewed for because of the same reason. I received feedback that my extroverted interaction style was seen as both a strength and a weakness. While my interviewer specified that she does not have concerns that I would ever SAY anything unprofessional, my interaction style might just come across that way to someone who was not as much of a fit with my personality as let’s say, my mentor. 

So now, as a result of these interviews, the program director recommended me for termination/matriculation into the masters program. I am devastated.

Keep in mind that I successfully completed my remediation plan. I have been excelling in classes as well as practicum. I have been productive in my research, and I have performing well regarding my assistantship duties (Funny, when my old assistantship supervisor came back from surgery after remediation was in progress, my ratings were suddenly satisfactory again!). Despite my massive improvement in all of these domains, the program director claims that my level of professionalism has regressed, and she is basing this solely on these interviews (GA interview and practicum interview). It is also worth noting that these interviews occurred within a week of each other, so I had not received feedback before the second one. 

I am not denying that I am talkative. I am not denying that I can be a little casual in the work setting from time to time. I am not denying that I have made mistakes, and part of my growth has been acknowledging my shortcomings instead of being defensive like I had been in the past. I had also enrolled at the age of 21, so I was not nearly as mature as I am now at 23. Yes I’m still young, but these experiences have had a drastic impact on my defensiveness and responsibility. 

I am just upset because I had made such an improvement in my overall level of performance, and all of that is for nothing given two interviews that did not work out during a time where my good standing had already been reestablished. There has also undoubtedly been a conflict of interest given the program director’s role as both the initiator of my remediation and my substitute assistantship supervisor. I am appealing the termination, and I honestly am not sure of my chances. My current supervisors (practicum and assistantship) expressed their willingness to speak on my behalf, so I am hoping this carries weight and speaks to my overall level of professionalism.

To be honest, leaving this program wouldn’t be the end of the world, as I had my reservations about coming here in the first place. The program has also been harshly criticized recently by several students of color for cultural insensitivity and a majority of student agree that there has been a general lack of support from faculty. A lot of red flags from the start of my time here.

So, my question is: Where do I go from here (given my appeal does not work and I am forced to leave after finishing my masters)? I know for a fact that this is my destined career path, and I want to apply to other PhD programs as coming here was clearly a mistake. I would have no issue getting letters of recommendation from my current supervisors, my GRE scores are still valid, both my undergraduate and graduate GPAs are stellar, and the program director said that there would be no explicit record of “termination” on my transcript. I’m just scared about my chances of getting into another program and how I will explain myself in potential interviews/personal statements. Oh, it is also worth noting that I have 5 publications and over 10 conference presentations, so my CV is definitely my strongest application asset. 

Any advice or opinions on my situation would be appreciated! 


TL;DR - Entered a clinical PhD program at the ripe age of 21 right after graduating. Got put on remediation. Completed remediation and have been excelling since. Didn’t do well in two recent interviews that were a week apart. Now up for termination and will still be able to finish my masters. Want to apply to other PhD programs. Would appreciate some advice.",12,5

There'd be the odd workaholic, but most of my peers were happy to have the occasional coffee catch up and Friday evening drinks were common. I'm quite a social person so I really enjoyed this and it definitely made work more enjoyable. 

Since completing my PhD, I've joined a small research centre in Social Sciences. We're a team of about 13, including two postgrad students. The team are not very social and many do not socialise, not even to take a lunch break or short coffee break. It's a very different atmosphere to work in, and for someone who gets their energy from socialising with others, I find it somewhat depressing. The energy within the office is often flat and sometimes even a bit negative/unhappy.

I've tried to encourage socialising and small breaks, but it hasn't been hugely successful. One of my colleagues even makes snide remarks implying that those of us who do take breaks (mostly the students and newer team members such as myself) do not work as much or as hard.

I studied Economics and Conservation Biology at a US University (I am American).  Over the past few years I have been combining the two with both paid work and volunteering in China.  

This past week a professor I have been doing some work with invited me to study an masters in Conservation Biology at his university.  It's the best for the subject in western China and the professor I would be doing it with it is renowned in government and NGO circles across the country.  I also have personal reasons and other projects that I can work on here, and it certainly doesn't hurt in-country opportunities being one of the only foreigners doing a unique form of study in China (e.g. not related to language or international relations, etc.). 

However, I know that the reputation of Chinese degrees overseas is average at best and a joke at worst.  I would certainly be more focused on what I get out of the time doing the degree rather than the degree itself.  After the program, I am thinking of applying to a western university for a PhD - likely in something along the lines of Environmental Economics.  

My question is, would having done a masters in China be looked down upon and hurt my chances of admission to a western PhD program, or would it be looked at as a unique and specialized experience that can really help in my research?

We would have a small talk when I made him coffee. Eventually, I quit working there and started working as a barista in another cafe, not on campus. Once he saw me in one of the study rooms in the department where I was studying and he came in. This was the first time we met outside that cafe on campus. He said: "" Since you stopped working at that cafe, I started making coffee by myself"". At that time I didn't think what he said was weird and took it as a compliment. I thought he was very friendly.

&amp;#x200B;

We started his module. Once I got a very low score on a test and got very worried I went to him to ask how the questions should be done. He explained to me and after that, I asked him for a book with solutions. He later sent me an email with it. In the email, he said that I did the hard question correctly and that coffee can help me for better concentration. I agreed with that and after that he said. ""I should not only teach you physics, but also coffee drinking"" to which I didn't respond because I found it inappropriate. He emailed me 2 days later again speaking about coffee. I thought I am misinterpreting things and replied.

&amp;#x200B;

That professor and I would meet sometimes in the department and have a few words. He came maybe 2 more times in that study room, but only when I was alone, not when my friends were there. Things got weird again once in one of his workshops on a Friday. He came to me and said “ You are dressed like you are going to a party. Are you going out tonight?” I felt extremely uncomfortable. I said “Haha, yeah” and continue to do my work waiting for him to go somewhere else, which he did. I heard the 2 students behind be saying that was very inappropriate. I was very mad that day at him, but I thought again that I am misinterpreting things. The Monday after he came to me in that study room when my friends left and offered to make me a coffee his way (which he has told me before how he does it). I said “ok” and gave him my cup. He asked me to come to the teachers’ kitchen where students are usually not allowed and said that it’s ok since there is nobody there. We were having a small talk and eventually, he said: “ You look very different from Friday. With that dress, with that charming dress.” I got too uncomfortable after hearing this, but I was trying to remain calm and I said that I regret wearing this dress at uni. And then he asked me again: “ Did you go out that night?” I felt even more uncomfortable after this. I said a few more words so that I don’t leave things awkward and left.

I am currently a 5th year postdoc in the process of making my next career move. I’ll try to make things to the point.

I am looking to relocate my family back to my home state. I have just received a job offer for a non-tenure track instructor/Core Lab Manager position at a university back home. There is no research involved and is a 12 month position with a start date in August. 

However, I have a video interview for a tenure-track position with an osteopathic medical school that is being built and will be affiliated with the university I have a job offer for next Monday. 

While I understand I haven’t even done a first-round interview yet with the DO school, I am extremely hopeful for a position. I received my interview invite within 3 days of submitting my application packet. And there are other things, so my next question may be jumping the gun quite a bit.

Is it completely unethical and wrong of me to accept the instructor position (I have asked for an extension of acceptance since it would involve relocating and selling our home plus we need further time to discuss other things) and then IF (big IF, I’m trying not to go on assumptions or hopefulness but that’s hard to do) I was offered a tenure track position at the DO school, to rescind my acceptance? Has anyone out there been in a similar position? 

Any suggestions on how to navigate this would be immensely helpful. Thank you in advance!",0,2

The person who asked me asked how long this would take me and how much I would charge. I told them they would have to write me a proposal specifying exactly what they need me to do before I give them a rate and timeframe. 

While I’m waiting on that proposal, does anyone have any insight on what instructional design consultants charge per hour or where I would find that information? I’m guessing my lawyer hourly rate would be way too high. Any thoughts?

It's largely a conceptual course (very little math) that aims to explain the fundamental principles of chemistry and relate them back to everyday applications.  Two of my goals with this course are (1) to stir up an interest in science among those who might think it isn't for them and (2) to increase scientific literacy so students are able to analyze basic claims to determine if they're legit or not.  It's been a lot of fun to teach, especially as I'm used to classes full of STEM majors but now I'm lecturing to students majoring in art, theater, business, nutrition, graphic design, law, etc.  Their excitement and wonder is contagious!

One thing I'd like to add to the course is a short video (3-5 minutes) every week that highlights a chemist (or scientist) working in various fields talking about their background and what they do.  For example, one week is a chemist working in cosmetics, next week is forensics, then agriculture, then pharmaceuticals, etc.  I'd especially like to feature stories of scientists from underrepresented groups (women, Hispanics, Blacks, etc.) so students see that science, and chemistry in particular, is open to anyone.

The only website I've found along these lines is [Behind the Scenes at MIT](http://chemvideos.mit.edu/all-videos/).  Can you recommend another?  (If not, I think I might just launch my own and begin interviewing various scientist friends.)

What should I put in this section when submitting a poem?

The first half of my presentation does a really good job of situating my research in the literature, how it fills the gaps, and explains why it’s important.

It’s about a 16 min talk, and the first half is background, historical context, the problem with the literature, solutions that are slowly being discovered. Second half is what I did: my method, results and a discussion.

Is this a normal set up, should I change it or stick to how I have it?

I was feeling fine, confident even, before but now I’m kinda freaking out. 

Any help is appreciated :)

Edit: UPDATE: Everything went super well! I kept all my slides and cut two down where I could get the point across by saying a little less. I decided that everything else I had was necessary to properly tell the story leading up to my research. It turned out to be an amazing experience. Even made the audience laugh. Thanks for all the advice!",4,2

Help Reduce Attrition Rates!,"I am currently a graduate student (Cal State University, Long Beach) working on developing a tool to measure Science Identity in current undergraduate STEM students. Science identity has been found to be connected to STEM student's experiences throughout their college career, as well as their willingness to persist in the field. Therefore, this new measure would aid us in gaining a better understanding of the struggles and successes endured by college STEM students to ensure that the best support is provided and to ultimately help reduce STEM degree attrition rates.

I've never felt this low.,"I'm not gonna bore you with a long rant, but the premise is - 

an extremely dumb group member of our team felt the need to plagiarize a part of the report we submitted in a class WITHOUT running it by us. Two other team members, and me were completely out of the loop until the professor (today) hit us the violation hammer.

Now, each of us is facing a grade penalty or up-to 10 marks deduction from the final score for something we did NOT do. I've made it so far in life being an academically excellent student. Even had an A in this class so far, and the finals are around the corner. 

I feel absolutely disgusted and hopeless and shameful, at the same time furious and a million other things.

Life is so unfair, I'm sorry for the rant.",27,30
