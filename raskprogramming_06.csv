The function should insert each line of text into lines, and increase num\_lines to however many lines the file has.

Its probably really simple but I've been trying to insert the text for several hours now.

This is what main.c would look like. Everything but read\_lines is already defined and working.

(this is a homework assigment, so main.c and the function declaration must stay the same)

    int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
    
        char** lines = NULL;
        int num_lines = 0;
        FILE* fp = validate_input(argc, argv);

        free_lines(lines, num_lines);
        fclose(fp);
    
        return 0;
    }

This is one of my attempts at trying to append lines, but I couldn't figure it out.

read\_lines.c

    void read_lines(FILE *fp, char ***lines, int *num_lines) {
        int i;
        int N = 0;
        char s[200];
        for (i=0; i&lt;3; i++)
        {
            while(fgets(s, 200, fp)!=NULL){N++;}
            char strings[50][200];
    
            rewind(fp);
            fgets(s, 200, fp);
            strcpy(lines[i],s);
        }

In fact, there were many installations in which the task of sorting was responsible for more than half of the computing time.""  


What do computers nowadays spend their time doing? in relation to algorithms you might study. As in 3-sat solvers are really good now. And work on them is important. But I doubt the total time spent solving 3-sat is a big % of all computation. Game rendering by GPUs would seem to be a big chunk of all computations.

    class Service

    dict[operation.GetType()]

I get null, I guess its becouse i cannot cast Activator.CreateInstance&lt;OperationBHandler&gt;() to IHandler&lt;OperationA&gt;.

The way I do it right now is that I have an array that saves every choice I make(Using and int of 1 and 0), and then when I get to the last choice, I initiate the tree again, and make all the choices until I get to the final value of the array, and choose the opposite of that value, I then remove the final value and replace it with the current value, so I can go down this path.

But we didn't exactly Go into insane amount of detail and wrote very huge programs we just did standalone stuff .  
So the question : Do you think it would be better for me to finish learning this language fully and start coding in it and maybe make a small program / Do a project I know i am very far away from that point with the current knowledge I have **OR** Because I know at the end of the day [VB.net](https://VB.net) isn't in demand that much and Python is more widely used ( I also have interest for ML ) and accepted in the programming community should i Just discard my Initial work of [VB.net](https://VB.net) and just start with Python and learn from this basic level I am at to the level I want to reach in python   


 (I hope this isn't too confusing I am basically worried If me switching to python halfway in the process of learning [VB.net](https://VB.net) will mess up my programming Concepts / get me confused as I know different languages have differences as [VB.net](https://VB.net) is my first language and I haven't learned it fully yet .

For example, Formula 1 allows for people to watch micro-sectors timings, weather, tyres, positions and so on ON REAL TIME.

I know their cars and sensor around the track are basically an utopia regarding IoT. I assume they run a server collecting data, and output a video feed in real-time. And this part I understand, I've worked with IoT and low-level data collecting and measurements.

&amp;#x200B;

The data processing and video rendering. This is what is magical for me, and I haven't succeeded on finding how it works exactly.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to work on something like that, maybe on open-source projects. I find it amazing and I believe I could give time and do a nice work on it, creating animations and so on. I would like to start.

But I don't want to start and make something useless. I would like to start by analysing current industry standards, like softwares that do this kind of stuff (e.g. receive X data, display Y on video), but how does it work at the moment? Is it an enterprise software, Adobe Premiere style, with customizable templates without need for programmers, and so on? Or is it all raw C/C++, custom-made video rendering? Or a mix of both? How exactly the data interfaces with the video rendering?

&amp;#x200B;

Are there standards for it? Known softwares and tech? I could say nowdays the most common APIs are RESTful-based, but how about this? Please enlighten me.

Also, are there open-source projects that this kind of software uses, so I could contribute?

I have built quite a few full stack apps using Node js.

An example would be calling an endpoint that returns a 3mb XML payload, and using that to sync an inventory on another database.

Coming straight to the problem, let's say there are two peers A and B. Now, let's analyze the scenario:

1. A requests a file from B.
2. B calculates the checksum of the file.
3. B starts sending the file to A in chunks, but sends the file metadata (which has the checksum of the file from 2. among other things) in the first chunk itself.
4. A reads the stream of chunks and on EOF, eventually receives the entire file.
5. A calculates its checksum and verifies if it's the same as that sent from B.
6. Everyone's happy.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the happy path.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem occurs between step 2 and 3. Let's say the file of interest to A is a text file. Now, just after step 2, let's say B makes an edit to the file. This poses a lot of problems, but the basic one to address is the fact that the checksum on the receiver node doesn't match anymore. As you can see, the problem is a lot worse if B changes the file once the streaming of chunks has begun.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I did think of a few ways to address this issue:

1. Acquire a write lock on the file immediately after step 1. But, this has to be an OS-level lock to ensure that no other process on the machine can make any changes to it. Not sure if this is complicating things a little too much.
2. Copy the file to a temporary folder and do the actual file transfer from the temporary location. There's an obvious issue here with large files, and also the added overhead of additional disk space requirement. Not something I want to do.

I study through anki, and anything to improve my study rate would be great! Since anki allows a user to format cards with html or css, I am hoping there is some way to apply this idea to card types.

I have no ability to code, so I did some googling. So far I have found that if I throw some 'typewriter' code into the field portion of an anki card, it works. This makes me wonder if there is code to get the words to display one at a time in the center, and then display the complete statement once done.

Here is the code that I found worked in anki with a cloze type card. [Source is here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33486228/how-to-fade-in-reveal-one-letter-at-a-time).

    div {

It's not the most novel thing out there, but it certainly is fun to build something like that (read 'learning') and such software is certainly the need of the day. The project is, I would say, well past its initial stages and I'm now spending a great deal reading up things to implement stuff - which I feel is a good sign. But there's a lot more to do.

Considering where the project is at right now, I think it's the right time for me to start searching for contributors who can build a desktop UI for the tool. I'm looking for open-source enthusiasts who work on anuglar.js \[or the like\] for a living and are interested in contributing to the project. If you're one of them, I'd love to chat.

At one part of my application, images are received from the client in a particular format. I need to do a lot of pre-processing on those images (such as transforming their object properties, resizing them, manipulating the buffers, etc.) prior to using my Adapter to upload them to AWS S3.

Is this the correct use case for implementing a Proxy or Decorator Pattern around the Adapter, or are there better methods to do it - such as just creating a service class that does the work to prepare the images, and then pass those off to the Adapter.

And i can google my way through anything. I want to build a program that will be a bit more complex than anything i done before. Figured i could ask this group what language they think i should try it with.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of the program will be to have a user be able take an image, a schematic. Then create boxes around valves and switches and defines them into a table. Then a logic filter created by the user and saved. Later on the user can select created logic filters and display it over the schematic.

&amp;#x200B;

An example would be is....

User uploads a picture. Highlights a section around a switch and labels it as S1; highlights valve 1, valve 2, etc... and calls them V1, V2, etc.....

Then can create another table for various groupings... IF SW2 is on; then V4 is ON and V2 is OFF. And make several more of these

Based on the table selected and the output, the diagram would highlight the boxes on the image with a color coding system. Like the SW could be yellow, ON valves would be green, and OFF valves would be red or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this makes sense.

I have done a bit of programming with c++, HTML and SQL. And a tiny bit with python and java. So with that mix i was thinking a JAVA type GUI and SQL DB to hold the logic tables was my first idea. But i am sure someone here may have a better solution for the noobie who is just screwing around.

This is _roughly_ supported by cmake but the documentation is crap. This is what I have working right now by cobbling together stuff from stack overflow and then cutting out everything that doesn't break the build:

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
    
    set(CMAKE_ASM_NASM_LINK_EXECUTABLE ""ld &lt;LINK_FLAGS&gt; &lt;OBJECTS&gt; -o &lt;TARGET&gt; &lt;LINK_LIBRARIES&gt;"")

    add_executable(test test.s)
    if(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL ""Debug"")
        target_compile_options(test PRIVATE -g -Fdwarf)
    endif()

So a few questions, why do I have to tell cmake to use ld to link and is there a better way to do it? Is there a `target_object_format`-esque function I can use to specify the object format instead of setting it globally? Is there a way to make cmake recognize a new extension instead of specifically telling it each file is `ASM_NASM`?

I am burnt out. I feel like my skills are deteriorating and I have no desire to program at all. It used to be my number 1 goal and I would spend 8-10 hours programming, designing and architecting. I had a couple jobs go to shit and the allure of the industry is gone. I am tired of being lied to by recruiters and clients, tired of being pushed too hard and tired of sitting in front of a screen for 8 hours of my day. Nothing interests me anymore, I couldn't give a shit about the framework or library of the day. The only thing that remotely interests me anymore is systems programming and old C bullshit and hacks. I don't have a degree so I don't have the background to do that anyways. I've been in the industry for 7 years and it seems like the breaking point is now. I am sick of this industry and all of the shit it brings and the corporate nonsense and the never ending fetishizing of big N. I tried to go on my own but the clients I unfortunately found myself wrapped up in turned out to be another huge crock of bullshit. I've had interviews with the ol' Big N and failed miserably, couldn't even understand what the guy was saying (guy had the heaviest accent I've ever heard). When I still cared the pressure was so much I started abusing drugs. Thankfully I stopped.

So to my question, is it over for me? Is there anything still here or should I do something else to make money? I absolutely detest web and app development. If you have felt like me, is there a light at the end of the tunnel? I'm pretty sure at this point I just want to take my ball and go home...just seems like such a waste of my life to learn all this for nothing. Are there any recommendations to get the spark back?

I'm writing a plugin for AviSynth which needs to draw on an existing array of bytes as if it were a graphics context/render target. With GDI+ I can do this:

	Bitmap bitmap(width, height, pitch, PixelFormat24bppRGB, pointer_to_bytes);
	Graphics* g = Graphics::FromImage(&amp;bitmap);

And from then on I can use GDI+ commands to paint on the bitmap.

I'm trying to do the same thing with Direct2D, but I just can't get anywhere. The best I can find are pages that give examples of how to fulfil a WM_PAINT message using Direct2D, but then add a tiny note ""Oh and you can also point to a bitmap, if you want,"" without going into any detail as to how.

I can create my Direct2D resources without a problem - factory, render target, brush - and thought I could do this:

	const RECT a = { 0, 0, width, height };
	hr = render_target-&gt;BindDC(g-&gt;GetHDC(), &amp;a);

where g is the `Graphics*` from above. But BindDC returns a ""The parameter is incorrect"" error. I also tried:

	ID2D1Bitmap* d2d_bitmap;
	hr = render_target-&gt;CreateBitmap(D2D1_SIZE_U({ (UINT32)width, (UINT32)height }), pointer_to_bytes, (UINT32)pitch, D2D1_BITMAP_PROPERTIES({ D2D1_PIXEL_FORMAT({DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM_SRGB, D2D1_ALPHA_MODE_UNKNOWN}), 90.0f, 90.f }), &amp;d2d_bitmap);

Let's assume you want to get the latest posts from their api, first you'd have to make a requests to get all the posts which is going to return an array of ids ?assuming this return 200), and then you have to make 200 single requests to get each post (which a lot, and efficient), if you want comments you have to do the same thing, make separate request to get each comment by its I'd . 

Now the question is how do apps on the play store manage to this in light speed, no loading indicators or anything that shows data is being loaded in the background, everything is loaded straight away. How do they manage to get it to work so smooth ?",7,1,2019-06-23 10:54:25

Essentially, my task is to take log data from a kibana database and create something that helps visualize the connections between different log messages.

Right now, I have a Python/Flask webapp that queries the database based on search terms, but I'm not sure how to proceed with the visualization. Here's what I'm thinking:

* I'm either going to make a UML sequence diagram or a directed graph with messages as edges.

* The edges (not nodes) must be clickable to display the full message content. (Or there must be some other way to view the full message content since messages are very long. Another option would be having a click redirect to another page that displays the full message content) 

Does anyone know what tools I could use for this? I've looked at D3.js and Cytoscape.js but it doesn't look like there's an easy way to do what I want to do. Specifically, clickable edges to display message content looks like it's not a common feature in visualization frameworks. Thanks!",5,1,2019-06-23 11:26:14

Hi,

Currently,  I'm learning JavaScript as my base language. I don't wanna jump into  fully web development right now but want to continue my learning through  making apps and websites.

I want to  start algorithmic problem-solving. Some senior programmers advice that  if I can complete 300 - 500 problems that would increase my coding skill  and problem-solving skill.

So my question is,

1. ***Should I've to switch C or any other C based language after JavaScript to start algorithmic problem solving or not?***
2. ***How much JavaScript I have to learn before switching another language?***",3,1,2019-06-23 13:19:39

Basically how everything works is like this. I have a CPU intensive ffmpeg processes that creates and edits some video clips and stores them in various folders from where they can be accessed and streamed from the users. All the mp4 clips shouldn't use more than 200-400GB yearly.   


Now what I understood is I need an EC2 instance and a S3 volume to store the videos. But I'm afraid I will run in the same problem I run in my VPS, which is ffmpeg running in the background is pretty CPU intensive and can make everything unstable. Can I use different EC2 instances, one for running ffmpeg and one for running the rest of the code? Is the process of moving the newly created clips by ffmpeg to the S3 volume easy and fast?

I'm writing a card game that is played through a console window. For the sake of simplicity, let's consider that there is 1 human player and 3 computer players.

I could just simply run a few conditional checks that dictate what the computer players do, which abide by the rules of the game, and just use an RNG on exactly which playable card to use. But I want more granularity than that.

For the computer players, I want to assign their difficulty (dummy, competent, advanced).

When it comes to differentiating between each players actions and their tendency to be either aggressive in their decisions or more passive, how would I integrate that into the computer players? How are decisions weighted and what dictates how choices are reached by the computer players? I would imagine a decision tree is used but I'm not familiar with anything in this particular area, so I don't know how to approach this or the correct terminology to research it.

Tell me if this makes sense: assign an integer value to card objects with certain cards having a higher value than others (lower values for regular cards, higher values for cards that affect other players negatively). Each player difficulty has a numerical preference which is used to determine what card to play when there is more than 1 that is playable. I don't know enough on this to know if this is the best approach or if this even makes sense.

I like to use lambdas instead of passing an anonymous class as a parameter to a method.

Our senior hates our approach because, in his opinion, breaks code consistency. 

We are designing new endpoints and usually the senior's handler only has a single method of 200+ lines. He also doesn't use lambdas.

Then they told me that I won't be allowed to use the internet while working on the project. This wasn't discussed before. Sure, I am very good at what I do, but I don't think I can do this.

about a year ago I wrote an x86 (yes, the 32-bit one) operating system from scratch and it was a lot of fun.

Now, I am thinking of repeating the exercise, but for an ARM device. I have mostly worked on the Intel side, so I have very limited expertise on even the lingo of ARM, but from what little I understand, the space is much less standardized, and I am going to have to pick a target and code specifically against its hardware.

So, the question I come here for is: what's a good board that I could pick as my target device?

In no specific order, things that would make a device ""good"":

- decent documentation/datasheet on how to program the hardware;  
- not sure if this is comes standard on ARM processors, but support for memory protection, virtual memory, and some form of user/supervisor mode;  
- support for flashing via USB from a development host;  
- tools and compilers usable from Linux (if I could get a decently modern GCC or clang, it would be awesome);  
- I don't really need a screen, nor do I care about being able to plug a keyboard via USB, interacting with the system via UART is plenty fine;  
- I don't care about having a ""disk"" either, but I would definitely like for tasks to be able to save/load data from some kind of storage, even if it's just a small area of non-volatile storage on-board;  
- I would like to be able to schedule tasks for a quantum and preempt, and am not sure if all ARM boards come with a clock built-in, so thought I would mention a clock capable of raising an interrupt is strongly desirable;  
- I don't really care for floating-point, it would be cute but I can live with integer only;  
- in a similar vein, if the board came with a few sensors (e.g. accel, gyro) that would be cute, but I see enough sensors in my day job, so I can do without programming yet another BMI160;

After years of using JavaScript, I decided to switch to C#. Why not? C# has strict types while JavaScript has no types. Everything is just `var`. I wish I can say this \`var\` is a string or an int, but it doesn't. Maybe my problem is that JS is a scripting language and C# is a programming language. Idk the difference.

TypeScript?

Let me just say that I freakin LOVED TypeScript. Data Types, classes, OOP, perfect! But there's one problem... debugging. I use a debugger, like in the web browser or in VS Code, and I try to evaluate `this` but it's JS compiled variable is `_this.` Even other variables I use get renamed a lot. And I swear, I turned on JS Mapping but many times, the lines don't match with each other. This was in an Angular project.

That's when I realized JS isn't worth it. I switched to JS because it's great to use one language in front and back end, and coding is really fast. But it's not worth losing data types and debugging benefits. From a developer perspective, I think JS is not worth it... yet it's one of the most popular languages ever. So I switched to C# and I've been a bit happer. (I only say ""a bit"" because Microsoft is annoying sometimes.)

I'm trying to make a hard choice, that's why I'm asking for help. 

For like 2 years i've been programming in Java, mainly webapps using Spring. (I should say i've been learning programming since i'm still at school). Recently, i've moved to .Net and i intend to develop an [asp.net](https://asp.net) web app. (At least i'll try to). Also i'd like to try some mobile app for my device, that should be useful for me. Nothing so big.

Thus comes my question -- what would be a better choice when developing a mobile app? I like Java quiet much, but since i've benn writing in c# that language appeals to me more. Also i have not so good memories with programming in android studio. A year ago i and my friends parcitipaded in a hackathon trying to create something interesting for mobiles, and the work with android studio was just a pain in the neck. There were a lot of bugs, the development process was so clumsy (Maybe we were just to inexperienced in this kind of work, but since then i got some kind of trauma connected to working in that IDE). But as i use c# more, Java is getting a little bit to heavy for me. (Though i still like that language). I've watched mosh video about Xamarin: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ZU6j59wL4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ZU6j59wL4)

And this is much faster to develop than my first lines of code using Java were.  
Though, having read some opinions on xamarin vs. native i'm uncertain, what i should choose.

So, basically my question: What are pros and cons of programming with Xamarin and with native libraries? What would be better for a beginner?  
If you could, would you give me some advice on mobile development? And also, i'd appreciate recommending some tutorials (Whether they're free or not).

1) **Navigation within a building.** The lab lead explained that we would upload a virtual map into our hololens so that if we say ""Take me Professor's \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ office"" a virtual assistant will lead me there without clipping walls and such.

3) **Navigation with Google maps.** Same idea as one but with Google Maps (API?)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not entirely sure why that as. I thought that maybe Ruby's meta-programming features might play a role in allowing developers to do more with less code. Most of the frameworks I've tried have required a ton of boilerplate to do the same things that Rails would allow me to do with ease.

&amp;#x200B;

I just thought I'd ask, what web frameworks do you think provide a similar level of productivity? Say you wanted to start a new business and needed to build, let's say some kind of marketplace, and you had a very tight schedule. What languages or frameworks would you use for that task today, in 2019?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking specifically because I'm hoping to find a more performant language than Ruby for a project, but might just stick with Rails if I have to give up the productivity for the extra performance.",3,1,2019-06-22 13:15:58

      getObj(""errmsg"").innerHTML = ""Username cannot be empty."";

     document.fLogin.submit();    
     }
       }`

i want to get the value of getObj(""Frm\_Logintoken"") as i can't pull the value from #Frm\_Logintoken

using Code:

    document.getElementById(""#Frm_Logintoken"")

this gives me null

because Frm\_Logintoken only gets it's value when i click submit .Code:

    &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""Frm_Logintoken"" id=""Frm_Logintoken"" value=""""&gt;

full [page code](https://hastebin.com/tuhazuhipe.xml)

i found this online   
Code:

    /getObj(""Frm_Logintoken"").value = ""(.*)"";/g

but when i run it ... it gives me the same line again ! it's [full code](https://hastebin.com/gurosatuna.xml)

another regular expression i found but don't even know how to use it

&gt;Quote:Example of a regular expression to search: before\_egrep='N1:getObj(""Frm\_Logintoken"").value = ""(\\w+)""'Here, N1 is assigned the value of the back reference - the expression in parentheses. \\w + denotes the main compound characters, this is a synonym for ""\[\_\[:alnum:\]\]"". Once again - pay attention to the brackets - this is the back link. At the same time, there are also parentheses in the source code fragment - they need to be escaped

i am trying to make an auto login script that works in the background like it

doesn't show the user the login form page but the only the page after it

and i have found this code online too but don't know what's about [it contains xhr](https://hastebin.com/iqutoriyag.xml) .

the line that Attracted my attention is   
Code:

    /getObj\(""Frm_Logintoken""\).value = ""(.*)"";/g

some notes :

i have tried   
Code:

    document.getElementById(""Frm_Logintoken"").value

but it gives me empty """" because

&gt;Quote:

it's in the Group 1 of the matches but i don't know how to get it from that group .

i can't var myString = ""something format\_abc"";

because i am doing this to get the value that i don't know !!

And testing this  in console results

it give me this ""(.\*)"" not the wanted value !!!

some notes

1-that value isn't static  
2- i want to make the code works automatic so fetching the line ""getObj(""Frm\_Logintoken"").value = ""3"";""  
from the page code manually  is unwanted thing.

199,by6b2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/by6b2s/best_language_for_mmo_dedicated_server_heavy_cpu/,Best language for MMO dedicated server? (heavy CPU load),"**TL/DR:**  Heavy procedural-generation on a dedicated, sharded MMO server for my new game.  Client is TCP via Unity C#. Play as server already made in Unity C#. What language has the best performance/scalability for a headless TCP server?  Not afraid of learning a new language, but it needs to be the ""best overall."" 

&amp;#x200B;

***CPU performance per thread and ease of multi-threaded programming is very important!***

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all,

I'm working on a new, procedural-generation-heavy game that will be single-player/multi-player/MMO.  For the single-player/multi-player part, I'm using Unity and [Telepathy](https://github.com/vis2k/Telepathy) (C# TCP networking).  It's taken a while for Unity/C# to grow on me, but I feel fairly productive in that environment now.

&amp;#x200B;

However, it's clear that for my game to really take off, I'll need to take the dedicated server/MMO bit very seriously, and using Unity for a headless server makes little sense.  Since each world is procedurally generated, the CPU load of the dedicated server(s) will be extremely high, and if I have 60+ worlds running at once in the game universe, that's some serious multi-threaded execution/optimization.  Each world is almost entirely self-contained, so communication between worlds will be very low, but doing send-new-procedural-terrain-chunks and procedural-action-validity-checks on 20 players per world is pretty significant. I'm willing to throw as much server horsepower as I can at the problem, but choosing the most performant multi-threaded language is a priority in order to save execution time &amp; server energy.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my programming background:

I started programming in Borland C.  Dabbled in C++ and was forced to make a few webapps in Java. Learned MIPS and 8086 assembly. CPU dense apps in MATLAB &amp; C.  I had to learn LabVIEW and wrote a few large (500k lines) apps with it.   Some of it was lightning fast.  Because multi-threading in LabVIEW is super easy to do, my C equivalent code was close but never as fast.  Then Python for 4 years of work, which was irritating but necessary.  Maintained some awful legacy Javascript+VB.NET+C# code.  Now dabbling in Unity C#, which has slowly grown on me.

&amp;#x200B;

While LabVIEW would be the quickest thing for me to use to get a multi-threaded, CPU-intense, dedicated server off the ground, there's got to be a better option, especially if I ever want someone else to work on it.  I'm not afraid of learning a new language, but I need to be convinced that it's the optimal choice if I'm going to go down that rabbit hole, hence this post.  I'm not one to learn new languages just for the fun of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks everyone for the direction and input!",24,15,2019-06-08 05:37:58
