The accuracy isn't important for my layperson use case, so automated translation is fine. Currently I have my eyes on Googles translation service, since its quality is right where I need it and the python API works well.

It's around 22k lines, with around 650k characters. If I target 6 languages, it comes around to requesting translations of around 4 million.

With Google services, the pricing is defined as `$20 per 1,000,000 characters`, so this would cost me around 80$. That's inside the 300$ free credit you get on google cloud services, so that's very nice.

But I don't know if that's a good approach. Do any of you have experience with translation services and could help me out? I'm processing the translation data from a python script, so something with a python API would be ideal, but if there's a good alternative I'm sure I could work around that too.

I actually think this is not going to solve our problems, so I'm currently researching ways to improve our company's development methodology. There are a few ways in which I think Scrum is becoming outdated, or where it doesn't account for everything in software development. Some examples: 

- In my experience, most Scrum teams have a difficult time handling technical user stories and bugs, because they don't fit the sprint goal.
- A lot of companies seem to have multiple projects per Scrum team. This makes it harder to define a team-wide sprint goal, because members of the team are working on different functionality. Also, sprint planning seems inefficient because members of the team help planning issues that they won't even work on.
- Right now our Scrum teams seem to operate within their own bubble. Code is owned by a team and knowledge stays within that team. Often features etc are implemented redundantly and teams have no clue about the features that other teams are building.
- Sprints are synchronous, where issues often have a very asynchronous nature. For example: sometimes your issue has a dependency to a change to some third party library. You can't estimate how long it will take for the library to pick up your issue and to release the change you need. Also, sometimes during the sprint you will find out that some functionality requires a major refactor, or that you estimation is way off because your easy way of fixing it was impossible. Cramming these kinds of issues into a fixed time-box seems to mess up your sprint a lot.

I have way more examples, but I'm planning on writing a Medium article, so I don't want to spoil everything yet. I encountered a lot of articles and videos that seem to share the opinion that Scrum has been a major revolution, but that it's becoming outdated. I wanted to ask you guys a couple of questions about Scrum within your company.

1. What are the biggest advantages of Scrum?
2. Which adaptions did you make to make Scrum more efficient within your company?
3. Do you work on multiple projects in the same Scrum teams? How do you handle this?
4. What are the biggest reasons of estimations being off?
5. Do you define sprint goals? Do you often fail to reach your sprint goal because you carry stories to the next sprint?
6. How do you handle support issues, bugs and technical stories?
7. Which inefficiencies do you see during the Scrum processes?

Again, I'm not trying to bash on Scrum (that seems to be the trend). I think Scrum has some major advantages to other software methodologies. That said, I think software development has outgrown Scrum and it is time for another revolution.

I'm currently developing a WPF .NET app (running code-first EF) and have a question regarding best practices when it comes to event handling and propagation in applications such as this. I'm a lead devops guy by trade, but haven't done much .NET so I'm not that good with best practices in this framework.

So, a typical ""flow of control"" in my app is roughly something like this:

     Main app window -&gt; Multiple custom user controls -&gt; Button that 
     opens dialog window -&gt; Dialog window -&gt; WPF controls

Let's say I have a user control (not the one listed in the flow of control) in the main app window that lists users of the system and their details. Let's also say that the final dialog window in the flow of control above contains controls that edit user data. So that when I exit that dialog, data will have changed in the main window user control and this will need to be reloaded.


What are the best practices for event propagation from the dialog, back to the owning user control, up to the main window and then back into the user control that holds a grid with user data?


In my current solution I have a custom routed event with an enum that I set in the event as the action that happened. In the above example this would mean that the final dialog would raise an ActionEvent with an enum value of USER_SAVED, which would then be propagated trough handle-&gt;re-raise up to the main app window, which would then call a function UpdateDataFromDatabase() on the user control with the user data grid. The main problem with this approach as I see it that I get sort of a ""superevent"" that will be used all over the app and will probably grow to be pretty big. Is there a better approach?


Thanks in advance!",3,1,2019-01-13 12:45:52

GREEN = CPU TEMP &lt;40

GREEN + YELLOW = 40&lt;CPU TEMP&lt;50

GREEN + YELLOW + RED = 50 &lt; CPU TEMP

&amp;#x200B;

So far I only have code that measures CPU temp once/second, I intend on starting from there:

&gt;import os  
&gt;  
&gt;import time  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;def measure\_temp():  
&gt;

&gt;while True:  
&gt;  
&gt;	print(measure\_temp())  
&gt;  
&gt;	time.sleep(1)

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a few different codes that turn LEDs ON/OFF, make them BLINK once/sec, and that turn the LEDs on WHILST I press a button on my breadboard. So I guess, similarly to the button code (If no activity from button, do nothing, else, turn on) I would need the code to say something like '

Let CPU Temp = x

If x &lt; 40 deg C, then light up LED A; If = 40&lt;x&lt;50, then turn on LED A + LED B etc....""

I don't know if that is a correct theoretical approach to the problem? I'm very new to thinking like a programmer and only have very basic knowledge. For now all I can do is think of how to approach the problem in English, and then translate that into python once I know how I'm going to tackle the problem.

I am using my raspberry pi for this. So far I've used Python 2 IDLE, which is great, except it's not ideal for editing code once I've already executed it.  Alternatively I have tried creating a .py file, opening it in Python (V2.7), and simply hitting ""Run module"" which opens a new shell and runs the script within that new window, whilst leaving the code in the original intact and fully editable, but this still isn't ideal. I have notice that Thonny Python IDE is pretty much what I'm looking for as it splits the screen into two portions: the code I write on top, and the 'run' portion below, BUT this only works with Python 3 and above.

Does anyone know of a Python 2 IDE I can get that will allow me to code short scripts, run them, see the result, then edit and run again?

An issue I'm having is just understanding the structures and the purpose of their components.

Unfortunately throwing Doxygen blindly at this very non-Doxygen documented code has not worked. For example, the following code segment defining a struct:

     /*--------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Subregion:
     *   Structure describing an index-space cartesian region.
     *--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
    
    typedef struct {
      int ix, iy, iz;        /* Bottom-lower-left corner in index-space */
      int nx, ny, nz;        /* Size */
      int sx, sy, sz;        /* Striding factors */
      int rx, ry, rz;        /* Refinement over the background grid */
      int level;             /* Refinement level = rx + ry + rz */
    
      int process;           /* Process containing this subgrid */
    } Subregion;

The resulting Doxygen documentation has none of this, just the symbol names and types.

I know that a lot of answers to this will be ""JuSt ReAd ThE cOdE"", but when there are hundreds of thousands of lines of text, searching for these types, especially when there are 3-4 layers of typedefs between them and an object oriented design using macros and locally defined, commonly named structs^(\*\*), just finding where these are defined can be difficult.

This is why Doxygen is useful. However, Doxygen doesn't work on this code, unfortunately. One of my first thoughts was that I could regex my may way to something Doxygen like, but it went poorly. I've also tried [Sourcetrail](https://www.sourcetrail.com/), but it also has issues with this complicated codebase. Are there documentation tools (like Doxygen) or code exploration tools (like Sourcetrail) that can derive documentation from loosely-structured but contextually obvious comments like this?

\* This application was developed before C++ binaries were fast enough for their needs, so they wrote it in C with lots of macros to give a OOP-like experience. It's clever, but painful to work in.

\*\* Each .c file (never a .h) can have a Public and Instance struct defined in it, which is used locally to emulate static class and class instance data. However, all .c files use the same name for these structs (Public and Instance), which causes search hell, and really knocks both Doxygen and Sourcetrail on the head.",1,1,2019-01-22 12:51:14

However the Memory and CPU usage is too large for many devices, and even on better devices the application will freeze up after about 20 minutes of running.

First in an AsyncTask UDP Packets are received. These are decoded and appropriate messages are sent to the handler in the activity. The handler then updates the images, rotating some and moving others by an amount sent in the handler messages.

One reason this is not efficient is because these images are updated regardless of whether the new packets have changed values, i.e if the rotation was 23.4 before and a new packet comes in set to 23.4 the handler still updates the screen and uses memory. Is this conventional when showing real time responses over UDP or is this just clumsy design?

On devices like my phone, a lower end Samsung device, the memory usage is so large that most packets are lost. Other devices run great until the memory usage boils over to a point where not even a single packet will be received.

One solution I have found is to refresh the Activity every x seconds with an Intent. This seems to trigger the garbage collector more frequently and help handle memory more efficiently. However my boss does not think this an adequate solution as it causes the device to disconnect from the UDP socket and looks clunky.

I've also tried using Glide to handle the images more efficiently but this had an adverse effect.

Does anyone have any idea about a different approach I could take? Even just general thoughts on Memory management would be appreciated. Is there any precedent for similar applications that have to update images constantly from a handler while a UDP socket is connected in the background?",0,1,2019-01-22 13:19:05

Why?,"I am seeing this pattern a lot while reviewing my colleagues code and I cannot understand why they are doing this. When I ask they do not have an answer other than ""it's good to be explicit"". 

I agree. I think this is an unnecessary level of verbosity even taking into account PHP and type juggling. I don't believe there is a code readability argument here either.

        // I have seen both examples
        $fizz = ($foo &amp;&amp; $bar) ? true : false;

        if ($foo &amp;&amp; $bar) {
            $buzz = true;

            $buzz = false;
        }

        // Why not?
        $bang = ($foo &amp;&amp; $bar);

Even assuming there is a concern with the data types of $foo and $bar that is never going to change the fact that the evaluation of these two variables as such will always return a boolean.


Ironically the same person will then do this:

    if ($foo === 4) { do_thing(); }

What is 4? What does that represent? Is $foo going to be a string or an int? Could it be anything but an integer, a boolean? Are you okay if $foo is a string '4' or an integer 4? Better make sure $foo is the correct type because of that ===. 

I have to take their argument about being explicit with a grain of salt when they follow up with this.


So am I stupid and not seeing the obvious regarding the boolean?

The database is up to about 150 tables normalized for their various functions and works great. Unfortunately the previous devs did not utilize any framework like Zend or Symfony so the the Access Control Lists are implemented in SQL queries. The application level permissions were effectively implemented with Role-Based Access Control and work fine, but the Object-level access control lists from the database requires a bunch of joins for every query I'm running for my dashboard.

There are basically three levels of object level permissions (top level objects are ""contacts"").

* User is part of a group that has access to the contact and is an admin.
* User owns the contact.
* User has been individually granted access to the contact.

So currently the Contact, ContactGroups, and ContactUserAccess tables all have to be joined if I want a list of Documents, or if I want a list of addresses, or if I want a list of X I always have to get back to all those tables to make sure that person can see the totals for themselves. This creates a lot of logic in every SQL query.

I thought about storing contactIds in session so I could just run the queries and compare arrays to make sure the Id is in there, but I still have to update it each query because permissions change often enough and the query into PHP could theoretically return a result set too large for memory and take FOREVER to compare.

I'm a little lost - any guidance?",0,1,2019-01-23 23:40:35

I'm new to programming and think I might have done something that is not best practice. I have read in an xml file as a string (using Python) and chopped and changed some things, finally I write the string to a file with .xml extension. The file reads into the database I'm uploading it to with no problems, however when I try to open up the xml file in Notepad++ (for checking details) it is displayed as one long row.

I'm not sure if I have done something wrong or I should have changed a setting in Notepad++ because other xml files open with the tree structure I would expect.

If the first consonants include ""qu"", move the ""u"" along with the ""q"". Don't forget about words like ""squeal"" where ""qu"" doesn't come first!

For words beginning with ""y"", treat ""y"" as a consonant.

My idea is to create a function that splits the user input into an array of strings, then analyzes each index of the array's element so that I can apply the appropriate conditions to words that start w/ vowels, start with constanants, etc. I wanted to build a for loop that does this so that I can base all of the logic off of one loop. However, my current iteration of the code isn't working and I'm lost as to why. I've designated an empty string to add the elements to, and it is adding an iteration of each element for how many index position each element has.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an idea for a web-business in a specific niche; the features would be relatively straight forward, wouldn't require any new or proprietary type features  I don't think. Basically it just needs to be a searchable database for users, where back end users can upload their listing and potential customers can search for their listing. Simple. Here are examples of similar types of sites:

&amp;#x200B;

The basis for this site would be really simple; there is only one type of thing users would be posting or searching. What I'm wondering is; is this type of site something a completely code-illiterate non-tech person could build using WP and plug-ins? (and if so, does anyone know what specific plug-ins those would be)? Or is this something that would have to be built totally from scratch? I'd like to build this thing myself if possible, as I don't really have money to spend on it. If my only option is to hire a dev, how much would something like this typically cost?

&amp;#x200B;

Something to note also: The users searching for the posts wouldn't actually be purchasing anything from my site; rather they'd be directed to a weblink on a different, commonly used website where they could then make their ""purchase"". My site is more or less acting as a broker to help a specific niche user-group sort and find listings for a thing that can be found and purchased someplace else.

I'm having some weird issues getting a simple low-level file transfer in Python 2 work in Python 3. I basically have a simple server/client setup. The user, working on a prompt produced by the server, requests a file to be transferred to his machine from the client (this is a reverse shell setup, so the connection is initiated from the client machine and the server machine is sending commands to the client). It works without a hitch in Python 2, but I just cannot get it to work with seemingly equivalent Python 3 code. Here's the relevant functions:

Python 2 Server:
    
    def transfer(conn,command):
        conn.send(command)
        f = open('/root/Desktop/test.png','wb')
        while True:  
            bits = conn.recv(1024)
            if 'Unable to find the file' in bits:
                print '[-] Unable to find the file'
                break
            if bits.endswith('DONE'):
                print '[+] Transfer completed '
                f.close()
                break
            f.write(bits)

Python 2 Client:
    
    def transfer(s,path):
        if os.path.exists(path):
            f = open(path, 'rb')
            packet = f.read(1024)
            while packet != '':
                s.send(packet) 
                packet = f.read(1024)
            s.send('DONE')
            f.close()
        
        else: # the file doesn't exist
            s.send('Unable to find the file')

And here's what I've got in Python 3:

Python 3 Server:

    def transfer(conn,command):
        conn.send(command.encode())
        f = open('/root/Desktop/test.png','wb')
        while True:  
            bits = conn.recv(1024)
            if 'Unable to find the file'.encode() in bits:
                print('[-] Unable to find the file')
                break
            if bits.endswith('DONE'.encode()):
                print('[+] Transfer completed ')
                f.close()
                break
            f.write(bits)

Python 3 Client:

    def transfer(s,path):
        if os.path.exists(path):
            f = open(path, 'rb')
            packet = f.read(1024)
            while packet != '':
                s.send(packet) 
                packet = f.read(1024)
            s.send('DONE'.encode())
            f.close()
        
        else:
            s.send('Unable to find the file'.encode())

Based on my debugging, the file does transfer; it appears on my server machine as expected and opens just fine, but the command prompt hangs and the ""Transfer complete"" never appears. I believe the error is in this while loop:

    packet = f.read(1024)
    while packet != '':
        s.send(packet) 
        packet = f.read(1024)

It seems to be locked in this loop. I've tried multiple ways of writing it to no avail. Anyone have any ideas?",2,3,2019-01-07 00:18:24

But I just bought the physical copy of the new edition of Fowler's Refactoring and a big part of that is that the ""web edition"" is the canonical version. But there's the same wording in the ToS for getting access to the Web version ""personal"" and ""non-commercial"". Is the idea that you should buy a personal copy for each developer and then throw the book out (figuratively) when the developer quits?

I don't know maybe buying physical copies in the first place and letting interested developer take them home if they are interested in reading them is equally problematic in legal terms?

A user client (not staff) needs to create an account via web form to get a demo or purchase a product on an e-commerce website. Those are done in 2 separate websites. 

&amp;nbsp;

When the client user (not staff) creates an account via web form we ask for personal fields such as name, address. Currently, the email address is being used as the unique primary key to identify an account via SSO. Accounts can have others account linked to (a team account with multiple people under one admin).

Example from the store: 

&amp;nbsp;
https://i.stack.imgur.com/dE3yT.png
&amp;nbsp;


Question: how to minimize company field duplication in my database when client user is submitting company information via web form? As an example, the user can type: Wald Disney, Wald Disney Company, Wald Disney Company Inc, Walddi Disney, Disney Company when purchasing the product. That will result in multiple company entries that are in fact the same company.

&amp;nbsp;

These are the current methods being tried:


&amp;nbsp;

1-Same email address cannot be used in multiple accts. We use an SSO with email sign as a primary key to manage identity in multiple platforms. Restrict company owner as one per company.

&amp;nbsp;

2-I currently ask for Company Name, but this is not enough and we already have duplication. Another option is to provide a drop-down list with search, so all existing records of companies that exist in the database are displayed as drop-down which forces the user to see the existing options before submitting new records. Like in this form: https://www.contentful.com/contact/sales/

&amp;nbsp;

Note: the user can still ignore the dropdown and make a new entry.

  https://i.stack.imgur.com/If2QX.png

3-Ask for company website address. So I can identify company by using part of the string as unique identifier for company.


&amp;nbsp;

note: a lot of clients do not have their own company website but do have social media. Most companies are group of freelancers. It's unlikely that they will provide social media. I'm not sure if this will be redundant with the company website link.

&amp;nbsp;


4-My erp admin will have to accept new company entries manually on the admin portal as a task.

Are there any other methods to prevent this type of duplication?",2,1,2019-01-07 13:55:04

I've been posed with a challenge at work - my team spends hundreds of hours annually pulling Excel files from my company's Oracle tool: [Agile Produce Lifecycle Management](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/agile/product-lifecycle-management-process/product-data-management-process/overview/index.html)

My manager has asked me to automate this process. Our technical teams at my company are unable to get these files for us directly.

I got a minor in computer science but I haven't programmed anything in a few years.

I have been googling this, and I have made a simple scraper in Python using BeautifulSoup4 that can download files, but it relies on the fact that the URLs of the pages I'm pulling from are predictable.

The pages I'm using are interactive. They all end in '.aspx' and they have URL parameters (I think that's the right word) that tells the web app where to go. These parameters seem to be generated as I move around the site; I think the URL I see when I'm on a particular project page changes whenever I start a new session with the site.

**I'm certainly not asking anyone to do my job for me, but I would sincerely appreciate some leads.**

2. What tools or programming language should I learn to accomplish this?

Now I switch over to mac, and I get this error using Atom:

`OSError: unable to read font file '28DaysLater.ttf'`

So my first thought is mac is stupid, but then I open the exact same thing in IDLE, and it once again runs perfectly fine. So I'm thinking there is a problem with the path in atom somehow, but I don't know what it would be. Is there a way to maybe specify the path of the py file that is running (the font is in the same folder as the file by the way)?

Using atom-python-run package in atom.

Edit: Figured it out. Had to specify the path for some reason which is a bit annoying but I guess would be fine in the end.

Now this can be done quite easily using Python and BeautifulSoup. The problems is that different sites use different HTML class namings, so you need to add a line for every site, limiting the app.

Is there any way to create an universal approach so it detects the price in every store?",1,1,2019-01-20 15:05:35

So here are the two problems I'm trying to solve.

1. The first problem is an outputting problem. At the very end, I ask the user if they'd like to restart the program. If I input Y, it goes down the Y if statement. However, when I input N, the cout statement in the if Y statement triggers. Why is that?
2. The second problem is that I'm not sure how to restart the loop/the whole program. I thought if I reset the loop parameters back to the original value (stop = false), it would make the loop start again. However, that is not the case, and it just ends the program after I input something.

In my `public_html` folder, I have two folders. One is called `main`, and the other is called `report`.

When somebody navigates to `example.com`, I want to serve content from the `main` folder, but I want their URL to remain the same.

So, if they navigate to `example.com/file.html`, I want them to see the `file.html` file that's in the `main` folder, but I **don't** want their URL to change to `example.com/main/file.html`.

Similarly, if they navigate to `report.example.com/report1.pdf`, I want them to see the `report1.pdf` file that's in the `report` folder, but I **don't** want their URL to change to `report.example.com/report/report1.pdf`.

The closest thing I've been able to achieve is this:

    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.htm
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteBase /
    
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^example.com$ [NC]
    RewriteRule ^((?!main).*)$ /main/$1
    
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^report.example.com$ [NC]
    RewriteRule ^((?!report).*)$ /report/$1 [L]

That seems to work to some extent, but:

* If somebody navigates to `http://example.com/report/index.html`, the server incorrectly loads the `index.html` file from the `public_html/report` folder rather than the `public_html/main/report` folder. Normally that path would make sense, but in this case I'm trying to change that behavior.

* If somebody navigates to `http://report.example.com/test`, the server correctly displays the `public_html/test/index.html` file, but redirects them to `http://report.example.com/report/test/`.

I am a primary school teacher in desperate need of help. A coworker of mine has called on a favor and I need to help him create a password guessing game of sorts. What we would like to do is put an app (I'm assuming I could write this in JS) that is on an interactive white board that has a simple interface with a 4-6 digit password that can be typed in and guessed. We think the best way would be to have the teacher be able to write the password the same way you would on a computer or phone without being able to see the characters being written. Then onces it is set, students cant come up to the board and press on drop boxes with numbers 0-9 and try to guess the password. It's probably better if they can guess the 6 numbers all at once and then press a button and then see red or green lights if each number was guessed correctly or not. The interface can be simple as long as that it is clean. My coworker said that he will have it up in class and parents may see it.

I am not looking for someone to straight up do this for me, as I wouldn't mind using this as a learning experience for myself and my class. What I need rather, is for someone to point me in the right direction with some instructions if that's possible. However if someone wanted to do it AND provide instructions I would obviously be happy with that as well, but that's asking too much. I have some experience coding in JS and Python, so either is fine, however I have never used Python outside of an online IDE. My coworker will use it in class, but I will try and walk my year 4-5 students through it (if I can get it myself). I know how to teach the concepts in coding, however my own recently experience is... lacking.

If someone knows of a website or an app that does what I'm looking for that would be lovely as well, however I still wouldn't mind some advise on how to start this on my own. I would give it a go without the help but I'm at a bit of a loss for time as school just got back in and I'm up to my neck in preparation for test week.

I am a recent graduate in Computer Science and have been brought on by a company to create an API for our system to connect clients with ERP Systems. We are a small startup with only a few developers so it is challenging to create everything in house. I've been doing some research trying to figure out the best way to approach this project. Our new version is currently being developed with a lot of features from AWS, so naturally I looked towards using AWS API Gateway since everything would probably play nice. However, a coworker brought up using third party software to help with developing our API to reduce cost and prevent recreating the wheel. When looking up software that can help design and manage API creation, I am mostly seeing companies like Apigee and Mulesoft.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still struggling on the direction we should take, and due to my experience in this field, I am lacking a foundation in which to understand how these different software come into play. In simple terms, can anyone explain the difference between using API Gateway and services like Apigee and Mulesoft?

Then, later while you are testing, you have issues like ""Forgot Password button is wrong color"", ""Error text is incorrect"" etc.

So how do you manage these two kinds of ""todo"" lists? Do you just have two different systems, one for ""user stories"" and one for ""bugs/issues""? Do developers go back and forth between the two systems to find their ""todo"" items?

Do you need to look in both systems to estimate the remaining work to be done on the sprint?

A related question is how you handle the fact that User Stories go through a few different stages/states:

Hi guys, Ill try to keep this short.

I'm an intern at a small WebDev company, I've been tasked with making a website for a lawyer. The attorney wants his clients to be able to send him an emergency contact form from his website. I have the form made and used the [mailto:](mailto:example@gmail.com)attribute in html to send the email. It seems to work when tested on my own email.

He also wants to be able to get a notification on his phone of when an emergency email comes through from the web server. The issue is he wants one email, but he doesn't want notifications of non emergency emails, only ones from the form on his website.

I was hoping someone could just point me in the right direction for a solution to this. One of my ideas is a small Android app that syncs to his gmail and pings his phone anytime it detects a form being sent from the web server?

Or maybe there is a simpler solution to this? (php script?). I just started this internship and its definitely trial by fire so any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

I'm a web developer and I've always wanted to get into game development as a hobby. However, I want to avoid the problem of not having people to actually play the finished product. I have an idea as to why this happens. 

Far too often I see game ideas that are just impractical for the number of people and budget for the project. Like nobody is going to want to play your budget MMORPG when there is WoW, ESO, etc. And nobody is going to want to play your budget 3D looter shooter when there is Destiny, The Division, etc. AAA studios have the money and resources to make a game that will always be better in these categories. In my opinion, there are some game types/genres that don't work for solo/small dev teams. 

However, I do think there are some types of games that do work well for small setups. For example, I think something like a [clicker games](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html) are something that is actually practical for one developer with a tiny budget to make. [Agar.io](https://agar.io/) is another example that comes to mind. There's barely graphics, little AAA competition, etc. I think these are good qualities for a viable solo dev game to have.

The obvious choices would probably be some side-scroller or top-down RPG. But I feel like those are so common for indie game development that the market is incredibly saturated already.

I'm in a AP Comp Sci Principals class in high school, and I need to write a program for the AP Test. Since the test is in python, I'm learning/writing it in python, and using Pycharm as the IDE. Initially, i installed Pycharm on my USB, along with Python. When I program off my USB at home, everything works fine. But when I plug said USB into the laptops we have in the classroom, I'm greeted with Pycharm not letting me run the program because the interpreter is ""invalid."" Even though the Python interpreter I was using is on the USB. I try it again at home, and it works fine.

So after some research on the issue, i decided the best way (to my knowledge) was to turn my 16GB USB into a persistent USB using Linux Ubuntu, so that I could have python on the OS ,and hopefully run the python interpreter and Pycharm fine. The issue with that is that the Ubuntu loads up fine, but its not persistent, and i loose everything i changed when i reboot the computer. I spent 8 hours yesterday when I got home from school trying different methods, but nothing works. I've pretty much given up on this method.

With Google services, the pricing is defined as `$20 per 1,000,000 characters`, so this would cost me around 80$. That's inside the 300$ free credit you get on google cloud services, so that's very nice.

I actually think this is not going to solve our problems, so I'm currently researching ways to improve our company's development methodology. There are a few ways in which I think Scrum is becoming outdated, or where it doesn't account for everything in software development. Some examples: 

- In my experience, most Scrum teams have a difficult time handling technical user stories and bugs, because they don't fit the sprint goal.
- A lot of companies seem to have multiple projects per Scrum team. This makes it harder to define a team-wide sprint goal, because members of the team are working on different functionality. Also, sprint planning seems inefficient because members of the team help planning issues that they won't even work on.
- Right now our Scrum teams seem to operate within their own bubble. Code is owned by a team and knowledge stays within that team. Often features etc are implemented redundantly and teams have no clue about the features that other teams are building.
- Sprints are synchronous, where issues often have a very asynchronous nature. For example: sometimes your issue has a dependency to a change to some third party library. You can't estimate how long it will take for the library to pick up your issue and to release the change you need. Also, sometimes during the sprint you will find out that some functionality requires a major refactor, or that you estimation is way off because your easy way of fixing it was impossible. Cramming these kinds of issues into a fixed time-box seems to mess up your sprint a lot.

I have way more examples, but I'm planning on writing a Medium article, so I don't want to spoil everything yet. I encountered a lot of articles and videos that seem to share the opinion that Scrum has been a major revolution, but that it's becoming outdated. I wanted to ask you guys a couple of questions about Scrum within your company.

1. What are the biggest advantages of Scrum?
2. Which adaptions did you make to make Scrum more efficient within your company?
3. Do you work on multiple projects in the same Scrum teams? How do you handle this?
4. What are the biggest reasons of estimations being off?
5. Do you define sprint goals? Do you often fail to reach your sprint goal because you carry stories to the next sprint?
6. How do you handle support issues, bugs and technical stories?
7. Which inefficiencies do you see during the Scrum processes?

Again, I'm not trying to bash on Scrum (that seems to be the trend). I think Scrum has some major advantages to other software methodologies. That said, I think software development has outgrown Scrum and it is time for another revolution.

I'm currently developing a WPF .NET app (running code-first EF) and have a question regarding best practices when it comes to event handling and propagation in applications such as this. I'm a lead devops guy by trade, but haven't done much .NET so I'm not that good with best practices in this framework.

So, a typical ""flow of control"" in my app is roughly something like this:

     Main app window -&gt; Multiple custom user controls -&gt; Button that 
     opens dialog window -&gt; Dialog window -&gt; WPF controls

Let's say I have a user control (not the one listed in the flow of control) in the main app window that lists users of the system and their details. Let's also say that the final dialog window in the flow of control above contains controls that edit user data. So that when I exit that dialog, data will have changed in the main window user control and this will need to be reloaded.


What are the best practices for event propagation from the dialog, back to the owning user control, up to the main window and then back into the user control that holds a grid with user data?


In my current solution I have a custom routed event with an enum that I set in the event as the action that happened. In the above example this would mean that the final dialog would raise an ActionEvent with an enum value of USER_SAVED, which would then be propagated trough handle-&gt;re-raise up to the main app window, which would then call a function UpdateDataFromDatabase() on the user control with the user data grid. The main problem with this approach as I see it that I get sort of a ""superevent"" that will be used all over the app and will probably grow to be pretty big. Is there a better approach?


Thanks in advance!",3,1,2019-01-13 12:45:52

Make a program in Python that lights LEDs based on CPU temperature

GREEN = CPU TEMP &lt;40

GREEN + YELLOW = 40&lt;CPU TEMP&lt;50

GREEN + YELLOW + RED = 50 &lt; CPU TEMP

&amp;#x200B;

So far I only have code that measures CPU temp once/second, I intend on starting from there:

&gt;import os  
&gt;  
&gt;import time  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;def measure\_temp():

&gt;while True:  
&gt;  
&gt;	print(measure\_temp())  
&gt;  
&gt;	time.sleep(1)

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a few different codes that turn LEDs ON/OFF, make them BLINK once/sec, and that turn the LEDs on WHILST I press a button on my breadboard. So I guess, similarly to the button code (If no activity from button, do nothing, else, turn on) I would need the code to say something like '

Let CPU Temp = x

If x &lt; 40 deg C, then light up LED A; If = 40&lt;x&lt;50, then turn on LED A + LED B etc....""

I don't know if that is a correct theoretical approach to the problem? I'm very new to thinking like a programmer and only have very basic knowledge. For now all I can do is think of how to approach the problem in English, and then translate that into python once I know how I'm going to tackle the problem.

I am using my raspberry pi for this. So far I've used Python 2 IDLE, which is great, except it's not ideal for editing code once I've already executed it.  Alternatively I have tried creating a .py file, opening it in Python (V2.7), and simply hitting ""Run module"" which opens a new shell and runs the script within that new window, whilst leaving the code in the original intact and fully editable, but this still isn't ideal. I have notice that Thonny Python IDE is pretty much what I'm looking for as it splits the screen into two portions: the code I write on top, and the 'run' portion below, BUT this only works with Python 3 and above.

Does anyone know of a Python 2 IDE I can get that will allow me to code short scripts, run them, see the result, then edit and run again?

An issue I'm having is just understanding the structures and the purpose of their components.

Unfortunately throwing Doxygen blindly at this very non-Doxygen documented code has not worked. For example, the following code segment defining a struct:

     /*--------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Subregion:
     *   Structure describing an index-space cartesian region.
     *--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
    
    typedef struct {

      int process;           /* Process containing this subgrid */
    } Subregion;

The resulting Doxygen documentation has none of this, just the symbol names and types.

I know that a lot of answers to this will be ""JuSt ReAd ThE cOdE"", but when there are hundreds of thousands of lines of text, searching for these types, especially when there are 3-4 layers of typedefs between them and an object oriented design using macros and locally defined, commonly named structs^(\*\*), just finding where these are defined can be difficult.

This is why Doxygen is useful. However, Doxygen doesn't work on this code, unfortunately. One of my first thoughts was that I could regex my may way to something Doxygen like, but it went poorly. I've also tried [Sourcetrail](https://www.sourcetrail.com/), but it also has issues with this complicated codebase. Are there documentation tools (like Doxygen) or code exploration tools (like Sourcetrail) that can derive documentation from loosely-structured but contextually obvious comments like this?

36,36,aiponm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/aiponm/efficiently_update_images_in_android_activity/,Efficiently update images in Android activity with handler while UDP socket AsyncTask runs in the background,"I have an Android application that updates images based on decoded GDL90 commands sent through UDP. However the Memory and CPU usage is too large for many devices, and even on better devices the application will freeze up after about 20 minutes of running.

First in an AsyncTask UDP Packets are received. These are decoded and appropriate messages are sent to the handler in the activity. The handler then updates the images, rotating some and moving others by an amount sent in the handler messages.

One reason this is not efficient is because these images are updated regardless of whether the new packets have changed values, i.e if the rotation was 23.4 before and a new packet comes in set to 23.4 the handler still updates the screen and uses memory. Is this conventional when showing real time responses over UDP or is this just clumsy design?

On devices like my phone, a lower end Samsung device, the memory usage is so large that most packets are lost. Other devices run great until the memory usage boils over to a point where not even a single packet will be received.

One solution I have found is to refresh the Activity every x seconds with an Intent. This seems to trigger the garbage collector more frequently and help handle memory more efficiently. However my boss does not think this an adequate solution as it causes the device to disconnect from the UDP socket and looks clunky.

I've also tried using Glide to handle the images more efficiently but this had an adverse effect.

Does anyone have any idea about a different approach I could take? Even just general thoughts on Memory management would be appreciated. Is there any precedent for similar applications that have to update images constantly from a handler while a UDP socket is connected in the background?",0,1,2019-01-22 13:19:05

Why?,"I am seeing this pattern a lot while reviewing my colleagues code and I cannot understand why they are doing this. When I ask they do not have an answer other than ""it's good to be explicit"". 

I agree. I think this is an unnecessary level of verbosity even taking into account PHP and type juggling. I don't believe there is a code readability argument here either.

        // I have seen both examples
        $fizz = ($foo &amp;&amp; $bar) ? true : false;

        if ($foo &amp;&amp; $bar) {
            $buzz = true;
        } else {
            $buzz = false;
        }

        // Why not?
        $bang = ($foo &amp;&amp; $bar);

Even assuming there is a concern with the data types of $foo and $bar that is never going to change the fact that the evaluation of these two variables as such will always return a boolean.


Ironically the same person will then do this:

    if ($foo === 4) { do_thing(); }

What is 4? What does that represent? Is $foo going to be a string or an int? Could it be anything but an integer, a boolean? Are you okay if $foo is a string '4' or an integer 4? Better make sure $foo is the correct type because of that ===. 

I have to take their argument about being explicit with a grain of salt when they follow up with this.


So am I stupid and not seeing the obvious regarding the boolean?

The database is up to about 150 tables normalized for their various functions and works great. Unfortunately the previous devs did not utilize any framework like Zend or Symfony so the the Access Control Lists are implemented in SQL queries. The application level permissions were effectively implemented with Role-Based Access Control and work fine, but the Object-level access control lists from the database requires a bunch of joins for every query I'm running for my dashboard.

There are basically three levels of object level permissions (top level objects are ""contacts"").

* User is part of a group that has access to the contact and is an admin.
* User owns the contact.
* User has been individually granted access to the contact.

So currently the Contact, ContactGroups, and ContactUserAccess tables all have to be joined if I want a list of Documents, or if I want a list of addresses, or if I want a list of X I always have to get back to all those tables to make sure that person can see the totals for themselves. This creates a lot of logic in every SQL query.

I thought about storing contactIds in session so I could just run the queries and compare arrays to make sure the Id is in there, but I still have to update it each query because permissions change often enough and the query into PHP could theoretically return a result set too large for memory and take FOREVER to compare.

I'm working on a school assignment, and the goal is to develop a piglatin translator that does the following things:

For words beginning with a vowel, add ""way"" to the end.

If the first consonants include ""qu"", move the ""u"" along with the ""q"". Don't forget about words like ""squeal"" where ""qu"" doesn't come first!

For words beginning with ""y"", treat ""y"" as a consonant.

My idea is to create a function that splits the user input into an array of strings, then analyzes each index of the array's element so that I can apply the appropriate conditions to words that start w/ vowels, start with constanants, etc. I wanted to build a for loop that does this so that I can base all of the logic off of one loop. However, my current iteration of the code isn't working and I'm lost as to why. I've designated an empty string to add the elements to, and it is adding an iteration of each element for how many index position each element has. For example: if I run the string ""our"" through the for loop it is adding ""our our our"" to the empty string. Any help is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an idea for a web-business in a specific niche; the features would be relatively straight forward, wouldn't require any new or proprietary type features  I don't think. Basically it just needs to be a searchable database for users, where back end users can upload their listing and potential customers can search for their listing. Simple. Here are examples of similar types of sites:

&amp;#x200B;

The basis for this site would be really simple; there is only one type of thing users would be posting or searching. What I'm wondering is; is this type of site something a completely code-illiterate non-tech person could build using WP and plug-ins? (and if so, does anyone know what specific plug-ins those would be)? Or is this something that would have to be built totally from scratch? I'd like to build this thing myself if possible, as I don't really have money to spend on it. If my only option is to hire a dev, how much would something like this typically cost?

&amp;#x200B;

Something to note also: The users searching for the posts wouldn't actually be purchasing anything from my site; rather they'd be directed to a weblink on a different, commonly used website where they could then make their ""purchase"". My site is more or less acting as a broker to help a specific niche user-group sort and find listings for a thing that can be found and purchased someplace else.

I'm having some weird issues getting a simple low-level file transfer in Python 2 work in Python 3. I basically have a simple server/client setup. The user, working on a prompt produced by the server, requests a file to be transferred to his machine from the client (this is a reverse shell setup, so the connection is initiated from the client machine and the server machine is sending commands to the client). It works without a hitch in Python 2, but I just cannot get it to work with seemingly equivalent Python 3 code. Here's the relevant functions:

Python 2 Server:
    
    def transfer(conn,command):
        conn.send(command)
        f = open('/root/Desktop/test.png','wb')
        while True:  
            bits = conn.recv(1024)
            if 'Unable to find the file' in bits:
                print '[-] Unable to find the file'
                break
            if bits.endswith('DONE'):
                print '[+] Transfer completed '
                f.close()
                break
            f.write(bits)

Python 2 Client:
    
    def transfer(s,path):
        if os.path.exists(path):
            f = open(path, 'rb')
            packet = f.read(1024)
            while packet != '':
                s.send(packet) 
                packet = f.read(1024)
            s.send('DONE')
            f.close()
        
        else: # the file doesn't exist
            s.send('Unable to find the file')

And here's what I've got in Python 3:

Python 3 Server:

    def transfer(conn,command):
        conn.send(command.encode())
        f = open('/root/Desktop/test.png','wb')
        while True:  
            bits = conn.recv(1024)
            if 'Unable to find the file'.encode() in bits:
                print('[-] Unable to find the file')
                break
            if bits.endswith('DONE'.encode()):
                print('[+] Transfer completed ')
                f.close()
                break
            f.write(bits)

Python 3 Client:

    def transfer(s,path):
        if os.path.exists(path):
            f = open(path, 'rb')
            packet = f.read(1024)
            while packet != '':
                s.send(packet) 
                packet = f.read(1024)
            s.send('DONE'.encode())
            f.close()
        
        else:
            s.send('Unable to find the file'.encode())

Based on my debugging, the file does transfer; it appears on my server machine as expected and opens just fine, but the command prompt hangs and the ""Transfer complete"" never appears. I believe the error is in this while loop:

    packet = f.read(1024)
    while packet != '':
        s.send(packet) 
        packet = f.read(1024)

It seems to be locked in this loop. I've tried multiple ways of writing it to no avail. Anyone have any ideas?",2,3,2019-01-07 00:18:24

But I just bought the physical copy of the new edition of Fowler's Refactoring and a big part of that is that the ""web edition"" is the canonical version. But there's the same wording in the ToS for getting access to the Web version ""personal"" and ""non-commercial"". Is the idea that you should buy a personal copy for each developer and then throw the book out (figuratively) when the developer quits?

I don't know maybe buying physical copies in the first place and letting interested developer take them home if they are interested in reading them is equally problematic in legal terms?

A user client (not staff) needs to create an account via web form to get a demo or purchase a product on an e-commerce website. Those are done in 2 separate websites. 

&amp;nbsp;

When the client user (not staff) creates an account via web form we ask for personal fields such as name, address. Currently, the email address is being used as the unique primary key to identify an account via SSO. Accounts can have others account linked to (a team account with multiple people under one admin).

Example from the store: 

&amp;nbsp;
https://i.stack.imgur.com/dE3yT.png
&amp;nbsp;


Question: how to minimize company field duplication in my database when client user is submitting company information via web form? As an example, the user can type: Wald Disney, Wald Disney Company, Wald Disney Company Inc, Walddi Disney, Disney Company when purchasing the product. That will result in multiple company entries that are in fact the same company.

&amp;nbsp;

These are the current methods being tried:


&amp;nbsp;

1-Same email address cannot be used in multiple accts. We use an SSO with email sign as a primary key to manage identity in multiple platforms. Restrict company owner as one per company.

&amp;nbsp;

2-I currently ask for Company Name, but this is not enough and we already have duplication. Another option is to provide a drop-down list with search, so all existing records of companies that exist in the database are displayed as drop-down which forces the user to see the existing options before submitting new records. Like in this form: https://www.contentful.com/contact/sales/

&amp;nbsp;

Note: the user can still ignore the dropdown and make a new entry.

  https://i.stack.imgur.com/If2QX.png

3-Ask for company website address. So I can identify company by using part of the string as unique identifier for company.


&amp;nbsp;

note: a lot of clients do not have their own company website but do have social media. Most companies are group of freelancers. It's unlikely that they will provide social media. I'm not sure if this will be redundant with the company website link.

&amp;nbsp;


4-My erp admin will have to accept new company entries manually on the admin portal as a task.

I've been posed with a challenge at work - my team spends hundreds of hours annually pulling Excel files from my company's Oracle tool: [Agile Produce Lifecycle Management](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/agile/product-lifecycle-management-process/product-data-management-process/overview/index.html)

My manager has asked me to automate this process. Our technical teams at my company are unable to get these files for us directly.

I got a minor in computer science but I haven't programmed anything in a few years.

I have been googling this, and I have made a simple scraper in Python using BeautifulSoup4 that can download files, but it relies on the fact that the URLs of the pages I'm pulling from are predictable.

The pages I'm using are interactive. They all end in '.aspx' and they have URL parameters (I think that's the right word) that tells the web app where to go. These parameters seem to be generated as I move around the site; I think the URL I see when I'm on a particular project page changes whenever I start a new session with the site.

**I'm certainly not asking anyone to do my job for me, but I would sincerely appreciate some leads.**

1. Is this possible?
2. What tools or programming language should I learn to accomplish this?
3. Where can I go to learn how to do this?",4,5,2019-01-07 15:57:32

So I've got this line: `font = pygame.font.Font('font.ttf', 36)`

Now I switch over to mac, and I get this error using Atom:

`OSError: unable to read font file '28DaysLater.ttf'`

So my first thought is mac is stupid, but then I open the exact same thing in IDLE, and it once again runs perfectly fine. So I'm thinking there is a problem with the path in atom somehow, but I don't know what it would be. Is there a way to maybe specify the path of the py file that is running (the font is in the same folder as the file by the way)?

&amp;#x200B;

Using atom-python-run package in atom.

Edit: Figured it out. Had to specify the path for some reason which is a bit annoying but I guess would be fine in the end.

Added:

path = os.path.abspath(file)

path = path\[0:-10\]

The =10 simply cuts off the name of the file like '[name.py](https://name.py)' so rather than folder/program.py it gives me folder/",0,2,2019-01-07 16:00:33

My teacher gave us homework about recursive methods and while I do understand that most if not all of them are static I was able to solve the first problem which was:

Recursive static method called sumatoria, it returns an int and receives as parameter another int. It should start the operation from 0 until the parameter that received. Sumatoria(10) returns 55 and the code does that.

The second one is a little bit tricky therefore my questions.

Método recursivo estático llamado ***base10a2***, el cual recibe un entero base 10 y regresa un String con la representación del entero pero en base 2. Por ejemplo, ***base10a( 123 )*** debe regresar ***“1111011”.***

TRANSLATION: Recursive method called base10a2. It receives an int base 10 (how do I define this?), it returns a String with the representation in base 2. (How do you use two different base in the same method?)

    RewriteRule ^((?!report).*)$ /report/$1 [L]

That seems to work to some extent, but:

* If somebody navigates to `http://example.com/report/index.html`, the server incorrectly loads the `index.html` file from the `public_html/report` folder rather than the `public_html/main/report` folder. Normally that path would make sense, but in this case I'm trying to change that behavior.

* If somebody navigates to `http://report.example.com/test`, the server correctly displays the `public_html/test/index.html` file, but redirects them to `http://report.example.com/report/test/`.

How can I load the correct files and keep the URLs correct?",3,2,2019-01-01 23:13:17

I am a primary school teacher in desperate need of help. A coworker of mine has called on a favor and I need to help him create a password guessing game of sorts. What we would like to do is put an app (I'm assuming I could write this in JS) that is on an interactive white board that has a simple interface with a 4-6 digit password that can be typed in and guessed. We think the best way would be to have the teacher be able to write the password the same way you would on a computer or phone without being able to see the characters being written. Then onces it is set, students cant come up to the board and press on drop boxes with numbers 0-9 and try to guess the password. It's probably better if they can guess the 6 numbers all at once and then press a button and then see red or green lights if each number was guessed correctly or not. The interface can be simple as long as that it is clean. My coworker said that he will have it up in class and parents may see it.

I am not looking for someone to straight up do this for me, as I wouldn't mind using this as a learning experience for myself and my class. What I need rather, is for someone to point me in the right direction with some instructions if that's possible. However if someone wanted to do it AND provide instructions I would obviously be happy with that as well, but that's asking too much. I have some experience coding in JS and Python, so either is fine, however I have never used Python outside of an online IDE. My coworker will use it in class, but I will try and walk my year 4-5 students through it (if I can get it myself). I know how to teach the concepts in coding, however my own recently experience is... lacking.

If someone knows of a website or an app that does what I'm looking for that would be lovely as well, however I still wouldn't mind some advise on how to start this on my own. I would give it a go without the help but I'm at a bit of a loss for time as school just got back in and I'm up to my neck in preparation for test week.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a recent graduate in Computer Science and have been brought on by a company to create an API for our system to connect clients with ERP Systems. We are a small startup with only a few developers so it is challenging to create everything in house. I've been doing some research trying to figure out the best way to approach this project. Our new version is currently being developed with a lot of features from AWS, so naturally I looked towards using AWS API Gateway since everything would probably play nice. However, a coworker brought up using third party software to help with developing our API to reduce cost and prevent recreating the wheel. When looking up software that can help design and manage API creation, I am mostly seeing companies like Apigee and Mulesoft.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still struggling on the direction we should take, and due to my experience in this field, I am lacking a foundation in which to understand how these different software come into play. In simple terms, can anyone explain the difference between using API Gateway and services like Apigee and Mulesoft?

Then, later while you are testing, you have issues like ""Forgot Password button is wrong color"", ""Error text is incorrect"" etc.

So how do you manage these two kinds of ""todo"" lists? Do you just have two different systems, one for ""user stories"" and one for ""bugs/issues""? Do developers go back and forth between the two systems to find their ""todo"" items?

Do you need to look in both systems to estimate the remaining work to be done on the sprint?

A related question is how you handle the fact that User Stories go through a few different stages/states:

 * user interface design
 * core implementation (remove technical risk that it can't be implemented)

So far I only used it to get the division count, e.g.:

    console.log(Calc.getDivisionCountByTwo(8)); // returns 4

Hi guys, Ill try to keep this short.

I'm an intern at a small WebDev company, I've been tasked with making a website for a lawyer. The attorney wants his clients to be able to send him an emergency contact form from his website. I have the form made and used the [mailto:](mailto:example@gmail.com)attribute in html to send the email. It seems to work when tested on my own email.

He also wants to be able to get a notification on his phone of when an emergency email comes through from the web server. The issue is he wants one email, but he doesn't want notifications of non emergency emails, only ones from the form on his website.

I was hoping someone could just point me in the right direction for a solution to this. One of my ideas is a small Android app that syncs to his gmail and pings his phone anytime it detects a form being sent from the web server?

Or maybe there is a simpler solution to this? (php script?). I just started this internship and its definitely trial by fire so any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

I'm a web developer and I've always wanted to get into game development as a hobby. However, I want to avoid the problem of not having people to actually play the finished product. I have an idea as to why this happens. 

Far too often I see game ideas that are just impractical for the number of people and budget for the project. Like nobody is going to want to play your budget MMORPG when there is WoW, ESO, etc. And nobody is going to want to play your budget 3D looter shooter when there is Destiny, The Division, etc. AAA studios have the money and resources to make a game that will always be better in these categories. In my opinion, there are some game types/genres that don't work for solo/small dev teams. 

However, I do think there are some types of games that do work well for small setups. For example, I think something like a [clicker games](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html) are something that is actually practical for one developer with a tiny budget to make. [Agar.io](https://agar.io/) is another example that comes to mind. There's barely graphics, little AAA competition, etc. I think these are good qualities for a viable solo dev game to have.

The obvious choices would probably be some side-scroller or top-down RPG. But I feel like those are so common for indie game development that the market is incredibly saturated already.

So what other types of games are good for a solo developer in 2019? ",0,0,2019-01-26 12:45:21

I'm in a AP Comp Sci Principals class in high school, and I need to write a program for the AP Test. Since the test is in python, I'm learning/writing it in python, and using Pycharm as the IDE. Initially, i installed Pycharm on my USB, along with Python. When I program off my USB at home, everything works fine. But when I plug said USB into the laptops we have in the classroom, I'm greeted with Pycharm not letting me run the program because the interpreter is ""invalid."" Even though the Python interpreter I was using is on the USB. I try it again at home, and it works fine.

&amp;#x200B;

So after some research on the issue, i decided the best way (to my knowledge) was to turn my 16GB USB into a persistent USB using Linux Ubuntu, so that I could have python on the OS ,and hopefully run the python interpreter and Pycharm fine. The issue with that is that the Ubuntu loads up fine, but its not persistent, and i loose everything i changed when i reboot the computer. I spent 8 hours yesterday when I got home from school trying different methods, but nothing works. I've pretty much given up on this method.

That causes a problem for \[programX safeProgramThatExecutesVirusIfRequested  randomInput\], because even a random input may cause the virus behaviors, if the random bits happen to be the virus or maybe half the possible inputs cause virus behaviors. If a program can run 1 particular virus, and we've seen it run maybe 20 nonviruses, then statistically 5% chance of the next random input being a virus. Probably lower, but also many more calls of it negates that advantage. People ask me to both trust safeProgramThatExecutesVirusIfRequested  AND they claim it may excecute virus behaviors, but I should call it anyways. Its not t heir fault, cuz they're calling some other binary blob that may on some inputs execute virus behaviors. Its outside our control. Since its outside my control what such a call will do, I should not call it. Its a mindless automaton, if we're lucky and dont get a program out to get us in some basic way. The mindless automaton is undeserving of trust without understanding its behaviors from its code. The halting problem proves that no thought process, which is a subset of computing process (such as statistical thoughts), proves that statistics of how often a program executes virus behaviors have no effect, beyond some constant (like we might know 80% of programs certainly end quickly and simply every time)... has no effect on future statistics. Chaitins constant doesnt have lower digits that we can ever know, the chance a program will halt, because we just cant know without running the program all the way through what it will do. If you say virus instead of halt, it works the same. So when people say trust a program because it has not executed a virus ever or recently, that is not something statistics repeat for. Next statistics are independent of earlier statistics, like a weighted coin flip. We should not learn to trust the weighted coins that rarely fail, or the fair coins that have so far not failed (newcombs paradox?). Halting problem etc is not limited to computers. It is also a flaw in Human minds, that we cant know for sure if some thought process will ever find an answer or if we will go ever deeper into subgoals and theres just nothing to find, or worse that we cant choose to do something else but dont know that we cant choose.

As long as the halting problem runs wild, I will not let it in, nor your programs which may contain it.

I want to build a web app and hopefully make it into a startup. It will be similar to https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-150-master-rich-chocolate. My current career path is in chemical engineering in Germany. Should I switch careers to software development? I would earn less money (averages: 45.000 Euros / year as Frontend Javascript developer vs. 63.000 Euros / year as a chemical engineer), but I would earn knowledge that would help me in the development of the web app. Is less money worth the programming experience?

**Elaboration:**

I want to build a web app, and, if I can prove demand, make it into a startup. It will be similar to this 
https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-150-master-rich-chocolate
. Basically, the app should help users scale recipes to fit their personal nutritional needs. Let’s call it “taylored food”. I need a frontend so users can create new recipes, add ingredients and add amounts. It should have a database (MongoDB) with the nutritional information for a lot of ingredients. When the user has added the recipe and his nutritional profile, some python calculations are done, and the final recipe is shown back to the user.

I will be working a full time job while developing “taylored food” on the side (plan: 15 hours per week). After 4 – 5 years, I plan to quit the full time job and pursue the startup full time. I should have built up enough savings and work experience by then.

The question is: should I get a full time job as a web developer, or as chemical engineer? 

Pro chemical engineering:

I am currently finishing my Master’s in chemical engineering in Germany. A job as a chemical engineer would be higher salary and easier to get, and the overall better option if I can’t make “taylored food” into a successful startup. 

Pro software development:

But, it is possible to become a software developer with a different academic background. My reasoning is, that when working as a software developer, I would learn things in my 9 to 5 job that would help me with the startup.

Here are my questions:

How specific would my 9 to 5 job have to be, for it to be useful for the development of “taylored food”? 

Do the languages need to be the same? 

Does the 9 to 5 job have to be in web development, or can it be in the development of desktop applications or smartphone applications?

I want to build taylored food with Javascript (frontend and backend) and a smidge of python.

How valuable do you think the learning experience of working as a web developer would be for the development of “taylored food”?

Can I build a minimum viable product of this app just by myself, while working full time as a chemical engineer? I am afraid that building this app in isolation will lead to unconscious incompetence: me writing bad code without knowing I have written bad code. How can I prevent that?

I really want to be able to be given a problem and solve it through c++. Like I know the fundamentals of the language but I don't think I have much of a grasp on it.

I'm really just trying to do coding problems on my phone when I'm bored but in the attempt to do that I realized how little I can actually use the language. Where would be a good place to get a deeper understanding than a 4 hour video on YouTube, hahaha.",3,4,2019-03-11 12:37:49
10,10,azwaje,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/azwaje/jsjquery_getting_referenceerrors_when_trying_to/,[JS][jQuery] Getting ReferenceErrors when trying to create instance of a class loaded via jQuery.getScript(),"Is there something about classes that means they can't be used if loaded via $.getScript(), or am I just a moron? (I accept the latter is likely!)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a number of HTML pages that load jQuery via &lt;script&gt; tags, and then also via &lt;script&gt; tags a small .js file that sets up the \*actual\* JavaScript each page needs to run. This uses jQuery's $.getScript(). The files are loaded sequentially, waiting via callbacks for $.getScript() to finish each time. The files in question mainly comprise a few utility files like text translations and functions common to many pages; the final file to be loaded is the actual one containing code dedicated to running the page. Once this loads, the page comes alive, as it were.

&amp;#x200B;

This final file will contain JavaScript that calls upon variables and functions present in the other files. This system has been running perfectly well right up until I started messing with classes, at which point it endured a sliding faceplant into coarse gravel! 

&amp;#x200B;

I've found that while variables and functions can be referenced just fine, classes cannot, and any attempt to use them results in a ReferenceError (not defined). However, if I load the file that contains them via &lt;script&gt; tags; then they work as expected.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, is there something about JavaScript classes that means, if you $.getScript() the file, they are not evaluated? This does not appear to be because of namespacing (I can access everything else) and is not a race condition or issue with the async nature of $.getScript() since the code that uses the loaded classes runs last (I can also load in an affected file manually via the console in DevTools, and still be unable to access anything but its functions and variables, no classes).

&amp;#x200B;

If I make a function inside one of these files that references/instantiates a class also within that file, $.getScript() the file, and then run \*that\* function... that works fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I use Javascript to create a new &lt;script&gt; element, then set the same file as its src attribute, then append that as a child of the page body, then I can reference the class just fine too (but as far as I can tell I lose the ability to have a callback run when the file has finished loading)

&amp;#x200B;

What's going on here? How come everything but classes is accessible via $.getScript()?

&amp;#x200B;

Help much appreciated, I feel like I'm missing something fundamental here which everyone else knows by default because this is NOT talked about anywhere on the web that I have found so far.

Now i've got a couple of approaches and dont know which one to use.

# Approach 1 (save Image when conditions are met):

    dialog(""save image?"");
    if (answer == yes) {
      if (fileExists) {
        dialog(""override file?"");
        if (answer == yes) {

        }
      } else {
        saveImage();
      }
    }
    
    

probbaly the easiest one to read, but: I'm calling saveImage() twice and if i would add more conditions, it would become very nested

&amp;#x200B;

# Approach 2 (stop if any conddition isnt met; saveImage at the end):

    dialog(""save image?"");
    if (answer == no) {
      return;
    }
    if (fileExists) {
      dialog(""override file?"");
      if (answer == no) {
        return;
      }
    }
    saveImage();
    

looks less bulky, but worse readability using return statements in my opinion

# Approach 3 (saveImage is part else-block [when user wants to save the Image]):

&amp;#x200B;

    dialog(""save image?"");
    if (answer == no) {
      return;
    } else {
      if (fileExists) {
        dialog(""override file?"");
        if (answer == no) {
          return;
        }
      }
      saveImage();
    }
    

additional else makes it more clear that saveImage is only called when the first dialog is corfirmed

# Approach 4 (Mixture/best of both worlds?)

    dialog(""save image?"");
    if (answer == yes) {
      if (fileExists) {
        dialog(""override file?"");
        if (answer == no) {
          return;
        }
      }
      saveImage();
    }
    

has the benefit of approach 3 while loking less bulky

I install all project dependencies on my machine. It gets ugly when I'm working on multiple projects at the same time. You end up with issues such as trying to get MariaDB and MySQL to co-exist. Over time, there will be ghost configuration files sitting around.

Here's my best, though likely biased, conception of pros/cons of different workflows. I'm interested in hearing the community's thoughts.

- Traditional : Can become management hell, has best performance.
- Docker : Limited to ~~Linux-based~~ host-os based containers, performance better than VMs, reproducible (can have weird kernel-land issues).
- Vagrant : Can use a variety of environments (FreeBSD, Windows), performance penalty, reproducible.
- PXE &amp; Network Booting : Annoying to make .ISOs for each environment, performance good (completely native).
- Qubes :  immature and more geared towards security, dependent on hardware supported by Xen hypervisor, limited supported operating systems.

Thinking about this problem a bit more, unit tests are not a replacement for a debugger. But, the debugger is often tightly integrated to the IDE. It seems like there's not really an easy way to run your IDE debugger in a container or VM. I feel that the Qubes and PXE approaches could allow for reproducible environments with use of a GUI. However, Qubes and PXE seem a lot more exotic than having disposable containers or VMs.",8,2,2019-03-17 11:58:35

The cache backend is redis. For a given product the factors that influence the price are:

1. sku
2.  channel
3. sub channel
4. plan
5. date

Currently the cache is structured like this in redis: 

    product1_channel1_subchannel1:  {sku_1:  {plan1: {2019-03-18: 2000}}}

The API caters to requests for multiple products, skus and all the factors above . So they decided to query all the data on a product\_channel\_subchannel level and filter the data in the app which is very slow. Also they have decided that, on a cache miss they will construct the cache for all skus for 90 days of data. This way only one request will face the wrath while the others gets benefited from it (only the catch is now we are busting cache more often which is also dragging the system down)

The downside of going with all these factors included in the keys is there will be too many keys. To ball park there are 400 products each made up of 20 skus with 20 channels, 200 subchannels 3 types of plans and 400 days of pricing. To avoid these many keys at some place we must group the data.

The system is currently receives about 10 rps and the has to respond within 100ms.

1. Is the above cache structure fine? Or how do we go about flattening this structure?

I did not take SSR (Server-side rendering) into account until we were well along in the build process. SSR is important strictly for SEO purposes.

At the moment, all of our routes are being done in ReactJS on the front-end, along with the rest of the website. The only thing we are using Symfony for is to make a call to the Directus CMS API to grab our data/content. We are also just specifying all of the routes in annotations in the Symfony controller, which allows us the deep link to that route.

What would be the best process to implement SSR rendering since everything is currently happening in the front-end? Does it make sense to stay on Symfony?",1,1,2019-03-17 17:52:59

I'm looking to add some debugging functionality. Ideally this will be in the form of a console window which outputs where the code currently is (class and method name) as a user navigates through and interacts with the application's GUI. I'd need to be able to isolate this to a specific package so as to avoid spam of native java output.


My main question is, is this possible? My understanding is the JVM is closed off but there are ways to interact with it by attaching things such as additional .jar files to it via command line arguments. This could contain an application that monitors for certain things and could provide output? I've also found stuff about the JNI however I'm still trying to get my head around how that works and whether or not it is appropriate for what I'm trying to achieve.",0,1,2019-03-16 09:33:14

However, i am doing a problem set from [Rosalind.info](https://Rosalind.info) and the question says

&amp;#x200B;

## Problem

The problem is to find a given set of keys in a given array.

**Given:** Two positive integers n≤10\^5n≤10\^5 and m≤10\^5m≤10\^5, a sorted [**array**](http://rosalind.info/glossary/algo-array/) A\[1..n\]A\[1..n\] of integers from −10\^5 to 10\^5 and a list of m integers −10\^5≤k1,k2,…,km≤10\^5−10\^5≤k1,k2,…,km≤10\^5.

**Return:** For each kiki, output an index 1≤j≤n1≤j≤n s.t. A\[j\]=kiA\[j\]=ki or ""-1"" if there is no such index.

## Sample Dataset

**5**

**6**

**10 20 30 40 50**

**40 10 35 15 40 20**

## Sample Output

**4 1 -1 -1 4 2**

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that a binary search basically will take the list A\[1...n\] and a value to search for k. it will take A\[n/2\] and check it against k, if it is bigger than k it will recurse the upper half of the list, if it is lower than k it will recurse the bottom half and will keep doing this until it finds the value in the list.

&amp;#x200B;

From looking at the sample dataset, i understand that the bottom list 'm' is being compared to the top list and returning the index location. what i dont understand is what the purpose of the 5 and 6 are. They seem to be the length of the two lists, but is that necessary in the code?

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate any help. I would have post this on Stackoverflow but i am trying to get to 15 rep and this seems like a question that the group would downvote to hell, considering they did one of my questions that i posted asking about why my output on a program i wrote was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

As I side project I re-built a website for a friend using PHP just for fun. Turns out it worked well and I kinda wanted to getting it out publicly to show him and also show others. Was wondering if anyone could give me some tips about getting it out publicly. This would be my first time doing this and I have some basic knowledge of it. For reference I have built the website using php (Slim and Twig) and also am using Mysql (phpmyadmin) which has been running using XAMPP. The only things I am not sure about are the following:  


\- Once I have my domain name do I need to get it hosted by the same provider? 

\- How will I setup mysql once hosted ?   
\- Can I setup a cron job on the hosting website?

\- Is there a ""Go to"" website for hosting and domains names?

I'm only about 6 weeks into my journey and I have noticed a few things right off the bat. These are some thoughts I have, just curious on your experience as well.

The various languages and framworks seem to carry the same concepts? What I mean is that if I have a problem, and I need to solve that problem most concepts are similar in their approach to solving that problem but the syntax is different. I hope that made sense. 

And I feel about a week ago I started to get it, the idea of programming and thinking like a programmer. The first two weeks I was stuck in this mindset of what language should I learn, what courses are the best and all that junk. I narrowed down more specifically to the job I am interested in and that changed everything. And recently, I can look at code and seem to understand what I am trying to achieve. Does this continue to grow?

Also - at what point do I need to start creating and move on from courses? I am fairly quick at learning, and sitting for long hours isn't an issue. But I am a believer of sink or swim, so is this question and bit more subjective towards what I am seeking to build?

I am a current philosophy major at ucla and I'm set to graduate this coming spring. I have tried learning programing about a year ago through code academy, but I found that it was hard to apply what I was learning or to really understand what it was that I was doing. I'm currently taking a course on the computational theory of the mind, and it rekindled my desire to learn programming. I have no intention on becoming a lawyer anymore and I would love to be able to learn C++ and work on software development. I wanted to know how you all got started in programming, as well as your thoughts on what my best course of action should be. I just hope you guys don't think it's too late of me, any advice is greatly apperciated!

I’m a mechatronics student who has a little project on his hands.
I’m planning to make a small game like system with an arduino, pc and a monitor in it. I have little experience when it comes to programming(c and c++ only)but I have an eagerness to learn more and I have some buddies who can help me out with that as well.

The monitor should display a leaderboard when on standby mode and when used it swaps to another screen, where player’s progress is compared to the best result + remaining time.

How to pull off the display side of the project? What language should I use to get a neat, simple look on the display and at the same time communicates with the arduino.

Can I pull this off with html, css and js? Perhaps it would be better to use rasperry bi instead? What are your recommendations?

I'm having a problem with a simple app I'm developing. So I have a listbox that has the letters A-F representing student grades. When I iterate through an arraylist of data, if the grade selected in the listbox is equal to the element in the arraylist, I want to display the previous element because that displays the name of the person associated with the grade. This is because the arraylist is formatted like [""Heather"",""A"",""Brian"",""C"",""Jose"",""A""]. I've been trying for a little bit but I can only get to the point where the same name is repeated in the textbox for every instance of a particular letter grade. For instance in the example I gave above I would be getting two occurrences of Heather in the textbox instead of Heather and Jose. I see that as a plus because the iteration is clearly working fine but there's just some small issue in there that I can't for the life of me figure out.

This project has quite a few modules that are focused on fetching, cleaning, and transforming data.

One issue that I have come across over and over is where to put the ""source of truth"" and how to translate this into objects within my program. So far, due to my incompetence, this has ended up with duplication and all kinds of nasty cascading issues whenever changes occur.

In particular, for reasons of speed, a few modules are located in Java. This code made requests directly to the DB (which is the current ""source of truth"" about data objects) and  ended up with a ton of domain model-type code that was replicated elsewhere in the project. 

I am using an ORM which auto-generates this code so it isn't a total nightmare (i.e. most changes just required running the code generator again) but I am also slightly suspicious of ORMs and cautious that any changes in the future or having to work in a language that won't auto-generate objects will derail things. Ideally I want to remove all the domain model-ish code, remove all the dependencies on unrelated stuff, and just have these modules during pure transformations.

My first step has been to remove all the DB code/SQL statements from these modules and move into the main API...but, of course, now these modules are just receiving untyped JSON with all the chaos that entails (and I am worried that I am about to do something unwise that I don't understand).

&amp;#x200B;

I hadn't written, learnt or so much as looked at a line of code until about 18 months ago where I landed myself an apprenticeship taking me into a FE developer role using Angular JS then Angular 6, I was always relatively techy and this line of work seemed right up my street and it is, I love the challenging aspects it has in regards to the need to problem solve, the ability to write clean effective code and the fact that at least on a FE perspective I get to create something that I can actually see the end result off I mean just wow that ability at your finger tips is such a rewarding experience.

&amp;#x200B;

There is one huge issue at the moment though that is nearly driving me away from the career and that's in the company I work for there is a strong drive to deliver features in a 7-8 days basis by meeting the MVP to ""please"" a board of investors/Po's and so forth, rather than delivering a product that is written well and to a high quality as it's all about faking a finished product &amp; smoke and mirrors which in itself leads to a huge amount of unnecessary tech debt in my eyes..  followed by the other issue that we have a fixed price contractual backlog on an Agile project where the contractual backlog doesn't even meet what the end users are expecting in various aspects - I should note this is no small time company they make hundreds of millions.... Which is what has irked me a little that such a successfully company  seems to run it's project (or at least the one I'm on) so badly. 

&amp;#x200B;

This constant need to push relatively high quantities of features out, not really fit for purpose amassing tech debt with a relatively toxic work environment is really killing the spark this career flared in me while for the first time in my life exposing me to relatively constant levels of mental stress and I want to change that.  


Which leads me onto my main question, and someone in my position who is obviously still a tadpole in the grand scheme of things with a lot to learn and a desire to be taught to better hone my skills, what advice could be given as to where I should aim to take my career once I finish my apprenticeship, as in what kind of product am I going to produce, what methodologies to they use, do they focus on quality not quantity or at the very least an acceptable balance of both, while providing a enriching environment to learn?

&amp;#x200B;

This might seem like an absurd question like surely something like this doesn't exists, but a point in the right direction to meeting some of those requirements would be greatly appreciated, hopefully this hasn't been a tedious read for those of who have read it but I look forward to your responses.

I have 10 classes (different emotions) My y array is simple and it looks like:  
y = \[4,2,8,7,9,1,0,8,1,2,2\]

my instances are a list of lists. I build them by finding words in the paragraph that are associated to an emotion with the data that I found. For example if the word abandon was in the paragraph it would have a list associated to it like:  
\[0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0\] 

So each of my paragraphs in my training and test sets will have a differing range of parameters since each paragraph is going to have a different amount of words.

So my x np array looks like:

We're having an issue hitting the max number of clients immediately after starting redis. When issuing a MONITOR command, we see thousands of INFO commands issued from our master server.


It seems to be baselining around 9000 connections most of the time. This will occasionally drop to a more normal value for our server for a couple of seconds, then it will immediately spike back to the ~9000 connections.


Anytime redis gets busy during the normal business day, we are hitting our max connections and our services start failing.

When I run the MONITOR command, this is a sample of what I see.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been having a number of extremely frustrating issues the past few days, which I have been round and round google trying to solve, tried all sorts of things to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem 1)

I can't import pygame in Idle with the error: 

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygame' - even though it is definitely installed, as in terminal, if I ask pip3 to install pygame it says:

Requirement already satisfied: pygame in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (1.9.4)

I think there may be a problem with several conflicting versions of python on my computer, as when i type sys.path in Idle (which by the way displays Python 3.7.2 ) the following are listed:

'/Users/myname/Documents', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python37.zip', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload', '/Users/myname/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages'

So am I right in thinking pygame is in the python3.7/sitepackages version, and this is why idle won't import it? I don't know I'm just trying to make sense of this. I have absoloutely no clue how to solve this,""re-set the path"" or whatever. I don't even know how to remove unnecessary versions of python.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem 2) 

Apparently there should be a python 2.7 system version installed on every mac system which is vital to the running of python regardless of the developing environment you use. Yet all of my versions of python seem to be in the library/downloaded versions. Does this mean my system version of python is gone? I have put the computer in recovery mode today and done a reinstall of the macOS mojave system today, so shouldn't any possible lost version of python 2.7 be back on the system now?

&amp;#x200B;

Problem 3)

When I go to terminal, frequently every command I type is 'not found'.

I have sometimes found a temporary solution is typing:

export PATH=""/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin""

but the problems always return!!!

As I say I also did a system reinstall today but that has helped none!!

&amp;#x200B;

Can anybody please help me with these queries? I am really at the end of my tether and quite lost, forgive my programming ignorance please. Many thanks.",11,1,2019-03-01 16:37:36

I by no means consider myself an amazing developer, but I do get the job done when I am handed a task. I am not someone that remembers the syntax for everything, and often find myself doing a quick search on the web for the syntax.

My team is integrating with a payment gateway called OpenEdge (this is *not* the programming language from Progress).  The problem we're having right now is that we cannot securely tokenize a CCN from the client side, so we'd have to send the CCN plaintext to our server to tokenize, and this increases our PCI scope.  (Another payment gateway we're using allows us to tokenize using JS securely.)

I've searched the internet for a third-party tokenizer, and I did manage to find TokenEx which seems to be the right idea, but it's not integrated with OpenEdge.  I dug through a *lot* of stuff, but didn't find anything.

Would anybody happen to know of a third-party tokenizer that's compatible with OpenEdge?

Thanks.

Update: If I could change the name of the post, I'd change it to ""Third-party tokenizer for payment gateway"", because I forgot that tokenization is not limited to payment gateways.  :\",0,2,2019-04-20 20:03:18

There will be a relational database (Postgres) to handle the web app portion of the app-

The goal of the app is to extract valuable information from the PDFs. The steps of this process -

* Parse the raw data out of the PDF
* Clean the data
* Classify it
* Extract key data values

**Problem**

Every time I process a PDF, I want to save the results at each step to ensure my algorithms are improving.

Should I store the results at each step in the same Postgres db or in some other datastore?

            item.co2 = co2
            item.is_public = is_public
            item.save()

have a lot of products and it would be much easier to add the subcategories to the csv as well. Simple example: product\_class: electronics. categories: mobile phones (1) &gt; android phones (2) &gt; samsung phones (3).

No money changes hands. It's all about bragging rights. Each of us picks four golfers, and the sum of the scores of all four is your score. Lowest score at the end wins. 

During the four days of the tournament, we check who is ahead or behind often. It's time consuming to look up 16 scores and total up our relative positions, so a few years ago I whipped up a quick and dirty Google Site that did the work for us. The Google Site would scrape the Leaderboard, which I could always find somewhere online as an HTML table, then write to a page showing our relative positions at any point during the tournament. 

I can no longer find the Leaderboard published as an HTML table. All the Leaderboard sources now seem to be rendered in JavaScript. This breaks my Google Site. 

I'd like to build a quick and dirty site that can scrape a JavaScript Leaderboard and display the totals for each of our four golfers. 

Here are my design constraints: 

1. I'd like to build this site somewhere where I could host it for free. It will get tiny traffic only four days of the year. It will require a tiny amount of storage.
2. I think I can teach myself what I need to know to scrape the JavaScript, but I'd like to make that process as efficient as possible. Decades ago I was a strong programmer, but that was pre-Internet and pre-C++. Stone Age. Twenty years ago I did teach myself enough Python to write network admin scripts. A few years ago I did teach myself some C++ (my son and I both took an online MIT Intro course). Naturally, though, the less I have to put into this to get it done, the better. When I Google this issue, it looks like there are lots of Python libraries that will make it work, but is Python the best bet? I can find services that will let me host a small Python site for free, but if I make a different choice, would I have better hosting options? 
3. Wherever I do it and whatever I do it in, I'd like for the environment to be stable and last for as long as possible. Ideally, I maintain this site for one hour per year and then it just works. 

To sum it up, what's the simplest way to build this site, and where is the easiest place to host it?

Since I'm relatively inexperienced when it comes to front-end development I wrote the front-end using basic html, css and javascript (for handling Ajax operations and element behaviors), to keep things simple. As the number and complexity of components started to increase, I started using a template-engine [Pug](https://pugjs.org), which seems to be fairly popular. At this point, when I need to add things like modals as well as aesthetic elements, I've started to include dependencies like [material-design-lite](https://getmdl.io) and [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). The current interface is basically a login page which leads to a dashboard that has a bunch of data as well as controls for functionality. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I'm facing is that writing the front-end code for something as straightforward as a form for a new transaction is very time consuming, and the development time for the UI is blowing up to the order of what it took me to write the back-end API. Is this expected? Are there any specific tools that I can use to cut down on this time; anything would be helpful but I had something along the lines of the UI-editor in Android Studio, in mind.",4,11,2019-04-29 07:03:44

I'm reading more into data layer implementations because everything I've implemented has been DOM scraping (for good reasons, i.e., not enough dev support, etc.).

I've seen data layers exist without a JavaScript object being visible on the front-end of the HTML.Ex. I can't find digitalData.event.... anywhere on the front-end of the site. How is this data layer implemented?

I have been working part-time job for 6 months now as a embedded software engineer. I got the job by completing the course that the company organised. 

The thing is I feel like I do not learn enough. For the past 6 months I had various success with the tasks I'm given. I have spent months on tasks that I feel like should have taken a few weeks. Now I am pretty fluent with the language (C) and toolkit that company uses, but the internal architecture of software I'm am working on is really challenging for me. I roughly understand how everything works, but some of the concepts are hard to understand for me.

I feel like my efficiency is at the bottom. Right now I'm sitting for third week on remaking one function. It is hard one, recursive one that calls few other ones. It took me around a week to understand what it fully does. Then I tinkered with it for pretty much a week. The are not much of docs to work with, but I am utilizing everthing I have. I asked my mentors about it, but one of them is really busy recently and he does not help much when it comes to details, and my second one is on holidays.

To give you background, I am 3rd year student (out of 5) and I still have to do a lot for it, it's pretty busy sometimes. I also learn a lot from work, but I feel like I am really slow. I work with my groupmate, and by the looks of it I can't say that he feels the same way I feel. He does more than I do, from what I can see.

So my question is dedicated mostly to seniors or middles, who work in the field. Is it ok for a junior to be slow just like I am? If you are junior, do you feel or felt the same at some point of you career?

Or maybe I'm overthinking. I do not get any pressure neither from my mentors nor from big bosses nor anyone. Noone ever told me that I am too slow. Maybe because I am not, or maybe because of work ethics. I want to understand that I am working with my speed. I am really trying to do things faster, I am trying to spend as less time on doing nothing at work, and this is just my speed of doing work. 

What is your opinion on that? I really need external input.",5,2,2019-04-29 14:17:31

I'm writing a program in C++ that involves the calculation:

x = 2^(N-1) mod N.

I need to run this calculation as N increases, but I'm running into a bottleneck due to the max integer size allowed in C++ (or the IDE I'm using, not sure which one is limiting me).

The calculation works until N is greater than 32.  It seems to me that integers are stored in 32 bits (with the first bit signaling pos/neg), and thus when N is larger than 32, 2^(N-1) becomes too large.

Normally, I would use logarithms to make this calculation more manageable for large N.  However, I'm having issues with trying this because the calculation also includes modular division.  I've been playing around with the math, and I'm having a hard time working out how a logarithm might run through modular division (or if it's even possible).

Has anyone encountered a problem like this, or have any tips so that I can make the calculation work for larger N?

&amp;#x200B;

On the project that I am working on at the moment, we are looking to allow users to create custom functionality using specific functions that we define. On top of this, we also would like users to be able to use usual programming constructs like loops, variables etc.. The project is written in Java so we will need a way to run the language directly as if by ""evaling"" code. 

&amp;#x200B;

One way I have thought about doing this is by using an already created language and just ""evaling"" that. For the admin part of the project, we use Java's ScriptEngine combined with groovy to allow us to execute functions as we need but we cannot do this for the users in the same way due to the massive security implications. If there was a good way to lock down the eval, that could work quite nicely and could be a potential way to go forward with this.

&amp;#x200B;

The other way I have been looking into is creating some sort of custom language or DSL in order to provide all the functionality we need but having fine-grained control over what users can and cannot do. This adds quite a bit of complication because with implementing a new language you are not only creating a new part of the project to be intensively designed and tested but also a potential security issue if everything is not done 100% correct. 

&amp;#x200B;

For this reason, I would much rather use a language that already exists and to be able to lock it down but I'm open to all different ways to do this. All of this is very theoretical so feel free to throw a complete spanner in the works and suggest something completely radical!

How could you take all of those models from all the users, combine them and use that big model to make identifying the foods more accurate for all users?

So I have been working with an AI developer to create an artificial intelligence that learns from transcribed conversations to then output its own conversations based on what it learned from the inputs.

This is for an art piece which will be shown as part of an installation. The conversation outputs of person A will be shown on one iPad and person B's side of the conversation will be shown on another iPad. I have been talking to my developer about this and he says that I need to host the AI on a cloud and then use sockets to allow the two parts of the conversations play separately on each screen with a delay. So essentially person A says something and then person B will say something... etc. I apparently need to host this on a website online so that we can access it on the iPads.

I have been quoted $300-$400 dollars for this job, but I just wanted to know what you thought about this price? Does it seem like a lot for a small job? I don't feel like there's much to do? Let me know if I've not explained myself well.

&amp;#x200B;

I come with some doubts regarding naming conventions and the general standard that is used out there in the working world, I have worked for two different companies and they used very different standards and names for their classes, properties and so on, so I was wondering whats a good convention that I could look up to learn from and stick to it? something that a lot of people consider the proper ones to use?

&amp;#x200B;

On my first job, lots of variables and controllers (because some of the programs were in windows forms) would use stuff like property\_Variable or txt\_variable.  
On another project I saw that most of the classes used something like propertyVariable or txtVariable

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to code in Ruby, it seems the most interesting and unique. But people are saying that it won't be that important in a few years. Some other people are telling me, that I should code in it if I want, because no time is wasted when I at least do something - and that I can always swap from RoR to Django in Python, because they are pretty similar.

Since I know the consensus is that C is low level and only really used for low level things, I figured I'd try learning a higher level language that has certain advantages over C, specifically in being able to write and test out a function very quickly, so I can see that more complicated ideas actually work pretty well before dedicating the time to really write them out optimally. I think it'd be cool to be able to change the variable values of a program and evaluate them as the program is actually running as it'd make debugging and testing pretty fast and easy, but that's completely optional.

My friend does the business side whilst I'm ostensibly supposed to do the technical side. However I feel a bit out  of depth as I know very little about  QR codes and app development in general (I'm a desktop developer).

My initial idea is to  use the QR code to display each item's  production information and intended destination by embedding  this data into the code itself. Then publish an app to read the QR  code, however other regular QR code readers should not be able to read anything.

I'm somewhat confused as to what a QR  code actually is, because from my understanding a QR is simply a link for the device to connect to, but other research suggests that the QR can also embed  data and possibly execute code.

My questions are:

1) Is it possible for QR to execute code, or be more  than just a web link? Is there an API I can read?

2) How would I print the QR code?

3) Is it possible to lock QR code data behind certain user profiles on the app? e.g. a client who logs into the app as a 'consumer' will see some data on the QR code but will be obfuscated from what a, say, 'customer' profile sees.

4) How complicated will the QR   look?

5) Is  there a way to track the amount of times a QR code has been scanned and where it is scanned from?

Alternatively, if you are interested in knowing more about  the project, I am looking for a UI/UX  designer and an app developer to  help  me out. We're based in the UK and it will  be about a 6 month project. PM me if you want more details!",18,1,2019-04-15 07:30:21

My Javascript is not great, I am learning it but it will be a while before I know it all. Here I don't understand what the ` is doing. Presumably that's some kind of base Javascript functionality, but I don't understand what it does?

Is there somewhere where I can input code and have it highlight what the syntax is? For example, in Python if I input something that contained ""Foo.attribute"" it would link me to using the attributes of an object.

It seems like it would be pretty straight forward to build seeing as how interpreters already know what all the syntax means.

Does this exist? If not, maybe I'll build it!",14,15,2019-04-15 18:20:38

I have an RAII object of type `manipulate`, whose destructor undoes the mutation it causes when it falls out of scope, much like `std::lock_guard`. The problem is that the user has to type `auto _=` or the destructor will get called before `model.get_info();` I don't like that the user has to type `auto _=`. Why would a user think to create an object that is never used?

&amp;#x200B;

My first idea was to make the constructor `[[nodiscard]];` but constructors have no return values. Is there a way to tell the compiler that `manipulate` rvalues should have lvalue lifetimes?

From reading the docs and checking some examples, this should set the application title in my KDE environment. But it doesn't, the application name is the name of the executable.

Is this a bug in KDE or am I doing something wrong?

This function is unmodifiable, and there are no options being passed in the third parameter, so I would expect this listener to be removed. It does not. This is the only time I'm referencing the function *listener*, I created it specifically to isolate the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

What I would really appreciate is some insight on why this could be happening, when I look online at why eventListeners can't be removed, it's always because the function passed is anonymous or was not the same, this is a named const, only referenced once, so it should be the exact same on removeEventListener.

You control the white circle with arrow keys. Your goal is to get the yellow circle (score). The game count how many scores you collected. The gray circle is some kind of an enemy. If you touch it it set your streak to ""0"" and teleports you and itself away in random location. The blue rectangle is a teleport. If anything touches it it teleports the object somewhere randomly. You also have a highscore which contains the highest streak you ever had. I added a reset button if you want to reset the whole game.

My first thought was that I'd need licensing, otherwise it's unlikely that I'll sell more than 1 copy ;). I have no experience with this at all so I'd like some input. So far this is what I've got:

* 2FA-style in-house licensing. Customer calls me when he's ready to activate, he gets a code on his screen generated from the current time and I give him the code that unlocks the program. The problem with this is that it requires me to be available and have access to my computer when they call.
* Using a free licensing service such as [License Spring](https://licensespring.com/). I'd rather go that route because it's more of a set it and forget it approach. I give the customer a license key when he buys it and License Spring makes sure it's only activated on 1 PC at a time. Too good to be true?

My ideal tool would allow me to create a new directory that thinks it is root.  It is not able to see any of the packages I've installed through my package manager, it can't see any files outside itself besides whatever OS files it needs, etc.  From the perspective of this new directory, it is the root folder of a freshly installed Linux (or whatever else) machine.  It has all of the default environment variables, default installed software, etc etc etc.  I want to be able to install whatever I want using a package manager and be able to have all of it gone when I delete the directory.  I want the environment variables that I change to only effect that directory, not all the directories around it.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, here are the reasons why none of the 4 options I listed fit what I need:

Docker does a lot more than what I need.  It's proprietary, it has a high learning curve, etc.  It's just too much.

Python virtual environments are really close to what I want, but I need something language agnostic.

AutoEnv and DirEnv I honestly haven't put too much thought into.  Autoenv hasn't been updated in a year, and DirEnv, although it looks to be actively updated,  still has a very small community.

Am I wrong here?","At my company we are currently discussing a new database design for our applications. We are a small B2B consulting company, our applications rarely see more than 100 concurrent users as they are typically only accessed by a client admin or analyst. We use MS SQL Server 2017 for our RDBMS.

The new design that our sr. devs have come up with involves splitting up data into separate databases, with common client information in one database, and then separate databases for each product in our suite (we have 3 distinct products). I have several issues with this design, one of them being that splitting up information this way takes away the ability to set foreign keys, and that it will be harder to maintain integrity in the long run. We process mainly transactional data, our largest product involves financial information.

The sr. devs have been pretty hand-wavy toward my concerns, saying that they will just enforce integrity in the application. They also say that FKs will impact performance too much and that they aren't necessary. I understand that FKs do come with a slight performance impact, but I'm unsure how the application is supposed to handle integrity without having an impact on that side. The other thing is that our applications are serving a very low number of concurrent users, and is not real-time. Given the type of information we are dealing with, my opinion is that maintaining rock-sold integrity outweighs the slight performance impact of FKs in our case.

Am I being crazy or unreasonable in this case? Is it common to use this type of database design in other enterprise applications?

Started work on a web app with C# in backend and jQuery/KnockoutJS in frontend. I still do occasional bugfixing but the company is focused on other bigger projects and I was assigned to some of those projects as a software tester. My current specialties are Selenium UI tests and JMeter load tests so I kinda want to make something of my own in my spare time (2-3 hours in the evening) to sharp up my programming skills even further.

So far I've made a desktop WPF app that allows you to run JMeter tests in non-GUI mode but without the hassle of entering a butt load of command lines into the console.

The app is more or less done so I'm wondering which simple project could I start that would occupy me for a while when I'm bored at home? Angular and React are hot topic around my area but what I really liked in high school and later in college was PHP and even though my code was a hot mess, it worked and was very fun.

I though about getting into Laravel and create some simple webshop or a forum-like website but I on the other side I would also like to work on something that would be of use beyond myself but I'm out of ideas.

Hello, 

In the company I work for, we want to have a database where we store information about every device we produce. We make different hardware devices (about 10k per year maybe). Each device is tested after production. The test checks voltage Levels etc. and checks some other data. Every device has a unique ID that is also collected. Right now, a worker just checks that everything is okay, and marks that device as checked. Now we want to keep the Information from every test, so we need a database or logging system that saves all this collected data. I imagine that like a mongoDB or similar, saving a JSON for every device checked. 

The logs might be appended later, if a device comes back for repair or similar, and also binary files should be stored. Ideally the data can be send to this system via REST-Commands. Also, later workers need a visual tool to get information about one or more devices (Note that these works usually can not formulate a SQL-like queries, so they need some input masks with option menus to find what they need), and to append logs after repair etc. 

Now, I could build that probably with a mongoDB, some Webserver with a REST interface plus some custom build Web-UI, but I think that this is kind of a typical application, so I would guess there are already some ready-to-use systems on the market. However, I couldn’t find any by searching the web. Maybe I am missing the right phrases for an effective search. 

Maybe someone knows what kind of software I am looking for?",0,1,2019-04-17 05:31:25

I've learned the basics of C# up to Classes (touching on Classes) and MySQL basics for backend database management obviously (up to connecting through C# to the DB and manipulating the DB for results back in the console in Visual Studio). The degree also includes CMS systems, MongoDB, User Interface design, and a lot more.

However I am very much struggling to learn apparently very simple things without a *LOT* of help from the teacher of my current MySQL class as well as mentors that are in the class when the teacher is unavailable. I am generally struggling with applying the lessons to the questions and I have been since the first C# class a few months ago. I am actually very much liking working with DBs over C# and was considering furthering my career path in that, but my latest assignment has shown me that I still only understand the very basics of DB management/C# and I am unable to apply the lessons to the assignments mentally.

I've had one person helping my throughout my schooling, an online friend, but he's currently indisposed for an unknown amount of time, and how much I have come to rely on him is really showing now. (Never gave me the answers straight, but he was always there to clarify things in layman's terms, etc). I typically pay him after each class for his help as well.

I always attempt to google my questions but a lot of this is ""unique"" to the assignment, so I'm always at a loss... and don't get me started on reading documentation with syntax and stuff that I don't understand in general. I can read some of it, but a lot of it is lost on me.

My question here is: Should I cut my losses and drop out and just focus on trying to make as much money as I can to pay off my student loans that I've taken out for school, or continue to just bother people for help? Am I just not wired correctly for this sort of thing, as much as I wish I was? 

I am *REALLY* enjoying learning these new things, but it's like I need someone there all the time because I'm apparently not ""learning"" per se, is how it feels, because I can't apply the lessons to the homework no matter how much I rewatch the lesson videos over and over again.

He's super friendly and despite me pressing specific details he would not tell me. He did let me know I would start off doing some QA with the multitude of Web Systems they develop.

I know they're systems were done with Javascript/C#.NET which I have a good base knowledge of.
I really just want to spend the next week I have studying up on what I should know to be a good employee on the first day.
I have afterall read horror stories of junior developers coming in on their first day and nuking databases (not saying this would happen but I would like to be prepared!).

[Here's a link to it on github.](https://github.com/hanjol/mergesort) (Don't worry, there's comments :)

&amp;#x200B;

It recursively calls itself by splitting the array in half and calling itself on both halves, but then it still has to compare the two sorted arrays. I found a way to do this without comparing every single element, since they're both already sorted, but I get the feeling it's still not very optimized.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this really a mergesort algorithm? Or did I make something else?

&amp;#x200B;

And, how do I optimize it for speed? I feel like it's kinda wasteful.

I'm currently working on a project and need a little direction. The project is essentially controlling a bot from a ""command center"". The bot is really low level and I'm sending all sorts of information through UART communication &amp; its wifi card. 

Originally, I was using putty for sending and receiving information. It was simple, put 192.168.1.1 for the host, drop the port number, baud rate, and another thing or two and it could communicate efficiently and accurately. The sensor data would come in and display line by line, and I could send characters back to the bot like I needed just by inputting. 

The thing is, I need to build a proper command center now though, and that involves live data visualization, ect... Charts for object detection, color underneath me, ect... Thus, instead of just seeing those numbers transmitted back to putty, I need to be able to manipulate/graph them live.

I'm trying to do the visualization in python (already wrote stuff that can do it live), and figured I could easily send and receive the data with some python libraries too. The thing is, I've never worked with networking stuff before, and I'm learning python as I go. 

I have no ideas what tools or libraries would potentially abstract the most of this for me. Originally, I was really, really hoping to just be able to use pyserial. It links up with the baud rate super well, the data comes in live, I don't have to worry about losing stuff. Then I realized yea I need to do this over a TCP connection, which I know nothing about haha. Now, I'm giving it a go with sockets, but I have no idea whats going on, cause I didn't know what a socket was until today. I was able to receive a packet, but I need everything to be transferred effectively and fluidly, which doesn't seem very easy if I'm involving tons more packets. 

Thoughts? I was told to give socket.makefile().readline() or something of the like, which I'll be trying soon after this.

Are any of the modern web languages / frameworks particularly well-suited for creating one-page dashboards? *e.g.* Imagine, waking up and entering how many hours of sleep you got, updating a calories counter throughout the day, or tapping a button to say, ""I worked out today!"" or ""I had a beer today."" And then later, building out some views or graphs.

I'm a backend dev interested in learning a new web technology, but don't have too much free time. So, I'm trying my best to limit features and make choices that ultimately save time. For example,

* I want it to be accessible from any device, but it does **not** have to be responsive / mobile. (It's not a focus I want to spend time perfecting or debugging.)
* I want to integrate a mature undo / redo library. (I don't want to have to write SQL to fix a database row every time I fat-finger something.)
* I *prefer* it to be Javascript-based (if there even is a thing that isn't?) so that I can draw from a multitude of libraries when it comes to building views and graphs.
* I *prefer* it to be hosted (and am willing to pay) so I don't have to spend time on administration. But, not a dealbreaker. I'm able to rent a VPS, install Nginx, etc.

I began a React tutorial, but I felt like it might be overkill for what I want to accomplish. Or, should I continue? I really like what I'm hearing about Rust, but it doesn't seem mature enough to be painless.

But im curious about what the simplest way to go about it, would be, as Ive not touched programming in quite awhile.

Have studied Python and C as part of a class for a year, and had a minor project in Perl, but other than that, my programming knowledge is quite limited. And maybe it could be doable in Excel?

to make it very simple, i would imagine that i have 3 tables (could be in separate documents), with a list of entries. Then I have some sort of process that picks one random entry from each of the tables, and then displays it in a spesific order.

example:

In a game called Mutant Year zero, you have a grid map, and when the players in the game move from one square to another, several rolls have to be made in order to figure out if the area is urban or rural, what sort of building or environment is there, how much radiation is in the area, if artifacts can be found there, what sort of threats can be found and what sort of mood that affects the area.

So, I would appriciate a few tips on what the easiest way to make a program that does all of these table-rolls for me, instead of having to spend a few minutes each time it needs to be checked.",6,1,2019-04-22 02:11:48

My original program worked well, but this new iteration doesn't behave properly. Instead of sorting a list, it adds some spaces between the entries and otherwise does nothing.

The goal of the program is to input a file name, and sort the list of data in the file. In particular, it's a 3 column list of school supplies. I've attached screenshots of [The list](https://i.imgur.com/jqtath6.png), , [incorrectly sorted list](https://i.imgur.com/C4ztGM8.png), , [Original Program](https://i.imgur.com/9JO9hKV.png), , [Current project](https://i.imgur.com/R2qhlvH.png).

Apologies for the formatting on the program screenshots, I couldn't get a full page screenshot unless I copy/pasted into a document. 

Again, not sure why it's just adding spaces and not sorting anything. Any help or direction would be a huge help.

quick edit: here's an example of a sorted list from the original program that worked: https://i.imgur.com/zklbQ05.png

edit number 2: I changed the dot operators in the compareString function to be arrow operators: -&gt; 

it flipped the list [upside down](https://i.imgur.com/YRxPFmi.png) instead of sorting anything. Equally confused but at least it's a new problem to lead me somewhere

Big boy EDIT 3: I changed all the comparison signs with strcmp, result is still the same. Here's a paste of my code as requested: https://textuploader.com/1dar2

I was handed an integrated control device whose original developers left our working group long before my time. I have been asked to port the exact functionality of this control device to a modern platform (like Arduino) so that my system can be a drop in replacement for the existing controller.

Only one problem: the source code is gone! All that I have to work with is the compiled firmware on the device. Thankfully, I have been able to force the microcontroller (an old Rabbit 2000 series) to regurgitate the contents of its flash modules and convert the resulting dump into a .bin file. I also know that the development language is Dynamic C (a C-like language for Rabbit microcontrollers).

I am struggling with the decompilation process. I theoretically know all of the information required to decompile, but I have not been able to find a decompiler from the binary to Dynamic C. I know the exact processor and microcontroller that the code was run on, and I even have the IDE.

At the end of the day, I need to learn the handshaking and data transmission routine between the controller and the many external devices that the current system uses so that I can mirror the controller on a different platform. I tried sniffing network packets, but there is far too much traffic between these devices to determine a meaningful procedure (as far as I know).   

Does anyone have advice on decompiling Dynamic C from a .bin file? Thanks!",11,1,2019-04-25 01:19:37

I don't care about the letters being a specific order, just that they match up with every possible save state.  

That way when a player chooses to ""save"" the game.  They also get a passcode, this allows them to load that state on any other game, without needing the memory file of that save.

I'm not really asking people to do my work for me. I am just wondering what algorithm or logic is required for me to do this.

Edit: Nvm I figured it out I'm dumb. I just iterate through every possibility, and simply have for each iteration, to randomly generate text that hasn't been used before.  And save that text inside its own key value)  {[0, 2, 3, 4, 1] = EETU}  Upon entering a value on the password screen, I will query to find a matching value and then return the key it belongs to.",7,1,2019-04-25 05:37:35

`char msg[128]; msg[0] = 'J'; msg[1] = 182; msg[2] = 0;`

My naive attempt to do this was to simply use a byte  string, where:

I am working on a project with an ""Order"" table. The Order has mostly fields you would typically find in an Order schema (product info, customer info, contact info etc...). There are also two other tables called ""OrderStop"" and ""OrderUpdate"" which have Many to One relation to Order (An Order Stop is basically an address/date/time, an Order Update are text updates for an order. An Order can have many stops and updates).

The Orders table will be queried quite a lot as checking the status of Open Orders is a core use case to the system. So my question is this. When an Order is Complete / Finished. Which of these two options would be better in terms of performance?

1. Move the Order to a new table called ""Completed Orders"" , to keep the Order table optimized and smaller for only active orders which will be queried more. I assume the OrderStop and OrderUpdates would either need to also be copied to new tables, or serialized to JSON as a field in Completed Orders

`SELECT * FROM completed_order WHERE ?`

1. Introduce an indexed bool column like ""isClosed"" to the existing Order Table?

`SELECT * FROM order WHERE isClosed = FALSE`

So basically would it be better to query a different table for Completed Orders? Or just add a where not closed to the existing queries to only get Orders not Closed.",2,2,2019-05-17 13:38:31

I need some clarification on a few parts of the article, I hope someone here is knowledgable on the topic.

So, you have to inject the DLL by using `openprocess` and `writememory`, correct? After that, do you have to use `LoadLibrary` as well? Or do you use **asm** inlined in the .exe to call `LoadLibrary`? 

If it's the latter (inlined asm), i don't see how exactly it would be done, because you only want to do `LoadLibrary` once, after that, you just want to `call`, in **asm**, the dll.

&amp;#x200B;

Im working on an application that receives lidar data, filters out some of it and then it needs to converts the data to a 2D map.

&amp;#x200B;

So after processing, my data could like something like this:

\[Angle in radians =&gt; measured distance in meters\]

\[0.15 =&gt; 3.20\]

\[0.17 =&gt; 3.22\]

\[0.21 =&gt; 3.26\]

\[6.11 =&gt; 0.70\]

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question is, how do i transfer above points to a 2D map in a generic way? The lidar makes 360 degrees scans, so the radians will always be between 0 and 2\*PI. The lidar starts at 0 facing north, then completes a cycle clockwise. What are the X/Y of the 0.15 =&gt; 3.20 measurement (lidar is point 0,0)? And 6.11 =&gt; 0.70? etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise i need to something with geometry functions, but i haven't found a generic formula/approach that works for the full circle. Anyone able to help me out here?

35,35,bq9huk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/bq9huk/good_way_to_consider_corner_cases/,Good way to consider corner cases,"Hello r/AskProgramming,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for some advice/suggestions on how I can consider corner-cases quicker and more clearly. I was working on this LeetCode problem:

&gt;Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence)

&amp;#x200B;

and found it took me a long time to get to a working solution. In the end, I did take a look at hints in the discussion area.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try my best to describe what I think my weakness is by contrasting it with a type of problem I'm rather good at. So problems that I'm good at are problems where the number of corner cases are small, for example:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Given a BST and a target of type int, return it's in-order traversal predecessor and successor.
2. Given a binary tree - return true if it's a BST otherwise return false

I'm good with these types of problems because I can narrow down the corner cases (and maybe minimize them). I just walk the tree, if I run into a null I do X and if I run into a valid node I do Y. The problem I have with the LeetCode problem is the number of possible input permutations are large so it's harder to consider all corner cases. Possible inputs like:

1. 1,2,3,4
2. 1,2,3,3,4
3. 3,1,2,3,3,4
4. 4,4,4,4,4
5. \[\]
6. etc

The input can be any length and the numbers can be increasing, decreasing, stay the same.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was solving the LeetCode problem I knew it was going to require a DP solution at first glance. I also knew how to get the longest increasing sub-sequence and felt this was just a slight modification of that problem. I tried a number of approaches before taking a hint and coming to the final solution.

1. Approach 1 - works for input \[1,3,5,4,7\] but failed for \[1,2,3,3,4\]
2. Approach 2 - fixed for approach 1 but fails for \[5,5,5,5,5\]
3. Approach 3 - fixed for approach 1&amp;2 but fails for \[1,2,3,1,2,3\]

Let me know if you want details on each approach but I hope my point is clear - the possible permutations of input is vast it's hard for me to consider all corner cases. It also wasn't obvious to me that I needed to tabulate the number of LIS I've seen so far not just the longest lengths, but I think I can fix this problem with more practice. My biggest problem seem to be difficulty considering large patterns of inputs.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

36,36,bqa0kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/bqa0kh/easy_and_simple_git_gui_clients_for_linux/,Easy and simple git GUI clients for Linux?,"I am working in a project where very experienced developers, less experienced developers, and engineers from other disciplines work together, and am setting up a shared workstation where will use git for revision management and also configuration control. This is essentially laboratory software. Engineers will be able to change the configuration and they will not have the time to learn all of git. Some of the younger developers know only subversion well, and they are, say, a bit intimidated by the complexity of git. After setting up the base system with Ubuntu, I had therefore the thought it might be nice to include an easy-to-use git tool.

I am using git myself since a long time. Most of the time, I was using the command line. Recently, I have switched to using Magit for all code editing tasks. I find it fantastic because it makes it very convenient to select diff chunks to split commits into subsets, and if necessary amend and squash local commits before merging them. However, I'd say it is not exactly beginner-friendly (as in, ""quick to learn""). I am also occasionally using gitk when solving complex bugs or merge conflicts. But as I am lazy, that does not happen too often, we are in the comfortable situation that we can almost always organize work in a way that avoids such conflicts. An other viewer that I like a lot is ""tig"", which is a console repository browser. As one might expect, it is very fast and can easily be used in a remote terminal. In the sense used above, it is not ""beginner-friendly"" either.

I thought there might be easier GUI clients which are more accessible, so I had a look what is on the market. I already knew ""git gui"", which I think is quite OK for committing changes, and simple enough. For [alternatives, I found](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools#Graphical_Interfaces_-_FLOSS) (and looked into): 

giggle, gitg, git-colab

I did not look into IDEs and huge commercial apps. Partly because I just hate them, and partly because the developers are already using their respective tool of choice, they are not going to switch.

My impression is that the viable variants mostly split tasks into committing a set of changes, with a simple interface, and viewing a commit graph, in the same way as tasks are divided between git gui and gitk. I think this makes sense because for an active task, like committing code,  one wants an interface which allows to focus as much as possible on the change to make, while for a browsing task, one wants to have a lot of information easily accessible.

I found gitg a nice variant of gitk, it has a bit less functionality but might be OK. 

For ""git gui"" - like applications, I found nothing that convinced me. For example, the giggle version I looked into does not allow to check out another branch, so it does not allow to make or initiate a merge. This is easily possible with git gui. Also, giggle conflates a bit the concept of history browsing and committing changes. I was even less satisfied with git-colab. 

What I miss is not so much that one cannot do everything possible but that basic functionality is not there or not easy to access. For example, I do not think that merging branches is a too advanced concept, as in many work flows, a developer should split changes into small orthogonal feature branches.

I think an easy GUI should support these functionalities:
- add files to staging
- ideally, add selected hunks (section of changes) to the staging area
- view diff of changes both in relation to latest commit and to another branch (e.g. the master)
- commit changed files
- possibly, have the option to amend a commit
- create branches
- check out branches
- merge branches
- launch a merge tool or editor of choice if there is any merge conflict

So, did I oversee something? Are there beginner-friendly, not overwhelmingly detailed, easy-to use GUI git clients for Linux? (I am not asking for huge, IDE-like proprietary programs which do not have a FOSS license.)

After a week I finish school. Since the summer, I want to start intensively studying programming and looking for work.

I found myself at a fork in the road.

The fact is that I chose WEB for my career. It's easier to get there, easier to study, etc.

At the same time, I have vision problems, for this reason, Frontend is not interesting for me, and I don’t have to be a Fullstac developer either.

For this reason, I focus on Backend.

Some time ago, choosing between PHP and Python for programming web applications, I made a choice in favor of Python. A developing programming language, it is possible to do not only the web, but I was also interested in artificial intelligence.

Now I understand that it’s not very comfortable for me to work with Python in terms of web applications.

Where the templates begin, I have not become friends with Django.

I understand that in PHP there are also necessary frameworks, but with the help of PHP I can program without frameworks.

In the future, I'd like to organize an IT business related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, plus a web programming.

But which way to choose at this stage?

I understand that if I choose PHP, I will still continue to learn Python.

So what is the focus now, if I choose a language to work as a programmer?

PHP is more popular in my country.

My problem is quite exquisite. I need to get the LinkerTimeStamp of an executable file before I upload it to the website(PHP - Linux). PHP doesn't have a function that does this, and even if it did the function may not work because some issues regarding how the executable image is created with the Delphi version we use at the company. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to work around with the LinkerTimeStamp function made in Delphi not sure if it's possible with a function made with PHP or even JavaScript.

&amp;#x200B;

If the server OS hosting the website was Windows my solution would be simple, since that's not case I'm stuck. 

I'm able to get the information I need but I'm not able to get to the website when I want it.

&amp;#x200B;

Is anybody able to figure out a elegant solution to my situation? I would really appreciate it! I spent the whole day trying to figure out some way to do it but I was just unable to =/",0,3,2019-05-29 21:14:49
56,56,bunjuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/bunjuj/help_with_ipc_between_c_exe_and_c_dll/,Help with IPC between C# exe and C++ DLL,"I'm working on a project that involves modifying and reading from a tree of objects using a Windows Forms Application in a C# executable (there's a TreeView and PropertyGrid), while a DLL injected into a separate process needs to receive that tree of objects and also read from it and make modifications. These objects are made up of different classes but inherit from a single class. The states of these objects need to be synced between the two processes.

I've chosen file mappings as my method of IPC, which I believe is sound, though correct me if I'm wrong. My main problem at this point is the actual synchronization process and all of the problems and design questions that brings. This needs to run as quickly as possible, with the least amount of overhead possible. I'm wondering if there are any libraries that will simplify this process or if I have to do everything myself. I've heard of COM but am not familiar with it, would that be applicable here and make my life easier, or is that antiquated at this point?

I actually have this tree serializable to a file via protobuf on the C# end, but I need to be able to write and read from these objects on the fly, and have it be fully synchronized. Serialization and deserialization is too costly. I'm also wary of race issues.

Some extra details about the project:

* The executable is initialized first and is the primary maintainer of the tree
* Though I'm not sure how much memory the tree could end up using when the application is in use by an actual user, I'm predicting a very large tree of objects with a fair amount of memory overhead to be frequent, assuming no optimizations are made later. This is the primary reason I went for a file mapping for the IPC, rather than pipe-messaging, though if you believe a pipe would still be better let me know.

I'm looking for any design ideas, examples of similar implementations to this problem, or libraries that might assist with this. If there are any more details about the project that would be useful knowing in answering my questions, let me know. Thanks in advance.",2,3,2019-05-29 22:06:00

I'd like simulate things such as birth/death/mutations of artificial organisms using math (easy to do in any programming language) but I'd also like to have a way to render these organisms in 3D using custom models and what not.

I've heard Blender has some python hooks, but I was wondering if there's any pure python libraries that I could just import and run along with? My experience with blender is limited, but I'm willing to learn if that's truly the best option...

I'm also open to suggestions on other languages/3d solutions, but I'd prefer the easiness and quickness of Python development...

How do I interpret the middle call to `futex`? Namely, there are a few things I don't understand:

* what is going on with the fourth argument? According to `futex(2)` in the manual, the prototype is 
 
          int futex(int *uaddr, int futex_op, int val,
                     const struct timespec *timeout,   /* or: uint32_t val2 */
                     int *uaddr2, int val3);
  however, I don't see how this has type *timespec.
* In my version of the manual, the futex_op FUTEX_WAIT_PRIVATE is not described. 

I'm running Arch Linux, and `strace` version 5.0.

EDIT: for context, what's happening is basically [this](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-core/issues/3277) problem. I was looking at the system trace hoping to gain some information. The reason I did this is because for some reason, the error message is displayed on my terminal, despite not being written to stdout or stderr. But in order to understand why, I think I need to understand this `futex` syscall.",0,3,2019-05-30 05:07:50

I'm looking for a way to save coding patterns and commands (mainly in python and related libraries) alongside some comments and easily be able to search through them (maybe adding some tags for quick search). Syntax highlighting would be a nice plus to have.

I am currently considering jupyter notebooks and github gists. At the moment I am more biased towards the former, but I'm open to suggestions!.

The intended use is for a print-on-demand web app.

I've done some googling, but came up empty handed.

I was hoping for a robust solution along the lines of webkit filters, css blend modes, or even server-side dlls, or cloud solutions like Azure's Computer Vision (which does have some neat image processing but doesn't offer auto-adjust as such).

I'm a product manager, so my tech knowledge is limited; maybe I'm missing something obvious? Or is the most probable way forward through github, scouring for smaller projects and hoping for the best?",6,3,2019-05-30 07:11:00

For my website if I purchased a domain from a different source could I do something that would allow me to use the domain with firebase to host the website instead of using the hosting service the original domain provider has?

At my internship I have a handful of tasks, one of which is to prepare a spreadsheet in a particular format by adapting one I pull from a company portal site.

Normally I have to click on the type of query I want, type a range of dates and which project I’m accessing, and hit enter. At this point, a customizable spreadsheet appears with rows and columns depending on what pieces of information you’re interested in. You can drag and drop rows and columns on and off the spreadsheet. Normally I drag four query rows off and then add two rows. Then I would click the “export to excel 2000” button and make sure to save as an excel file rather than a webpage.

I have to do this multiple times a month, and it takes a while because the site is slow. It’d be real convenient for myself (and would probably make me beloved by company managers everywhere in the company who are forced to use this obnoxious system) if I could automate this process. I’m not a CS whiz, so Please bear with me. My questions are as follows:

-This is a company site. Would trying to access data in an automated fashion make it look like someone was trying to steal proprietary data?

-This May be a sort of application/website combo. It seems to be run through a different application than explorer- some company portal that I had to get special permission to access. Does that make this harder?

-Is there some way to program the location of my data entry and geography of my mouse clicks/drags/drops such that a program/macro navigates the webpage as I would in person, or will need a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of the site to do this?

While his trading program works well when he is at home, the program lacks features for sending alerts when he is away from home. We have been brainstorming at possible solutions and would love to hear if anyone has a better idea than us (we don't have many).

The problem: when he steps out of his home, he is unable to hear his computer sound alerts when a specific event happens (price level is reached, stop loss, etc). We would need to somehow receive an alert to his phone (sms? email? app notification?) relatively quickly (ideally under 15 seconds).

Ideas: we had several ideas but not too many good ones... we thought of having a walkie talkie next to the microphone, having a call going between two phones while he is away, having a noise alert hardware (we saw one called NoiseAware),... None of these solutions seemed very good, some pricey and some not very feasable.

Question: I always like to go the programming route if possible, so do you guys think its feasable to program for example something when a noise happens (either loud enough or the alert specific noise) we can somehow get a quick notification on a different device? If it's possible, if you would be so kind to also let us know what would be the best programming language to create something like this so that we can search for a programmer with those skills.

I have access to every student's name and photograph through an education student management program called Phoenix Synergy SIS.

I have whitelist for product codes so I cant type or write anything else into textarea.

Found bad issue, I can write only static product codes like (first 16 is product code other 6 is how many products it is in list...):

&amp;#x200B;

0FAR12345H00123C + 00001P

0FAR54321H00321C + 00001P

0FAR54321H00321C + 00002P

&amp;#x200B;

So now I have two problems..

First problem, whitelist universal product codes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

0FAR12345H00123C + 00001P

0FAR543H00321C + 00001P

0F321H321C + 00001P

0R31H1C + 001P

&amp;#x200B;

Second problem is how to count these product codes under textarea + overall count.

&amp;#x200B;

Example under textarea counts:

0FAR12345H00123C: 5

0FAR543H00321C: 2

0F321H321C: 6

0R31H1C: 4

Overall: 17

	`$('#toFile').on('keypress', function() {`

`console.log('Textarea Change');`



`clearTimeout(timeoutId);`

`timeoutId = setTimeout(function() {`

`// Runs 3 second (3000 ms) after the last change`    

`saveToFile();`

`}, 3000);`

	`});`

&amp;#x200B;

	`toFile.addEventListener(""keyup"", event =&gt; {`

`const data = toFile.value.split(""\n"");`

`const result = data.unique();`

`info.textContent = result.length !== data.length ? ""Duplicate removed"" : """";`

	`function saveToFile() {`

`console.log('Saving to the db');`

`toFile = $('#toFile').val().replace(/\n\r?/g, '&lt;br /&gt;');`

		`$.ajax({`

			`url: ""test2.php"",`

			`type: ""POST"",`

			`data: {toFile:toFile}, // serializes the form's elements.`

			`beforeSend: function(xhr) {`

`// Let them know we are saving`

`$('#status').html('Saving...');`

			`},`

			`success: function(toFile) {`

		`});`

	`}`

&amp;#x200B;

	`$('.form').submit(function(e) {`

		`saveToFile();`

		`e.preventDefault();`

	`});`

&amp;#x200B;

HTML:

&amp;#x200B;

`&lt;form class=""contact-form"" method=""post""&gt;`

`&lt;textarea id=""toFile"" name=""toFile"" oninput=""onInput()""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;br&gt;`

`&lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Submit""&gt;`

`&lt;/form&gt;`

&amp;#x200B;

`&lt;!-- under here I want show count of product codes + overall count --&gt;`

&amp;#x200B;

`&lt;div id=""status""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`

`&lt;div id=""info""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`

This is how I want count product codes and overall:

&amp;#x200B;

We are having some challenges with our developer so I'm reaching out to the programming community (those who may know better) about program development.

&amp;#x200B;

We have an application that is branded as ""Enterprise"" level which has a .NET Desktop Application front end with a SQL Database back end.

&amp;#x200B;

The Desktop Application has a text file in its installation folder which contains the path to the SQL environment along with credentials for it. Typically our Developer populates this with ""SA"" credentials for SQL but sometimes it is set to a SQL Account with ""db\_owner"" permissions. How commonly are business applications setup this way?

&amp;#x200B;

There is also a Users table in the SQL Database which contains each users login credentials in clear text along with their individual SMTP information + credentials. How big of a concern should this be treated as?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Rate Our Developer

1)  A dog pic:  I  was thinking to add the pic in the 

`def __init __` (self, name, sex, age, **pic**)

 then :

self.pic = pic

\---&gt;  Now when I create  an istance of  Dog  (let's call it ''Carl'') .

I need   that  when  I call  that istance (self.pic = pic)  it uploaded  the image of  a dog that I have on my pc (which  it would be the carachter shape of the istance ''Carl'' in the  game)

&amp;#x200B;

Also I need  to define a function that  when called it let the  Carl istance to move and to bark

Do I need to specify ''bark''  and ''move'' function in the class  dog, or can I add  those  functions just to the character ''Carl''  without first putting them into the `def __init __` class dog example: `def __init __` (self, name, sex, age, **pic, move, bark** ) ?

The problem with this module however are two things:

1. If I run this program, an infinite loop happens, which results to a never ending cycle of opened windows.
2. Even without the weird infinite loop problem, if I fixed it with only the first loop in mind, then it'll just display all the windows at once instead of displaying them one by one. Creating confusion within the program.

Is there a way to display the modification windows one by one per row without having to display them all at once?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",0,8,2019-05-24 01:24:07

To put it as simple as possible, I'm building something that makes a specific type of game out of user-made text description files (kinda like inform, if you know that, just much simpler). Think of it as an interpreter. Most of what he, the user, would likely want his game to do can be expressed in those description files, but in case something can't, I'd like to have support for a script language where he'd been given access to a range of functions.  

I'm currently building the prototype in Java (interpreter, not script), but it should be a scripting language that has good interpretation support in general (I plan to make an interpreter in PHP/HTML5/JS as well, for example)

So, is there a scripting language, the easier to understand the better (target users are not programmers, just computer literate), that would be suited for something like this?

Pseudocode of what I'd  like to have in such a script:

    if (actors.status(""angrydude"") == ""scared"") {
        playfield.move(""angrydude"", 300, 450);

I'm working with a legacy job processing system, in which each task has a concept of smaller steps. This is a multi process system, where steps of a particular task might or might not be executed on the same worker ( all communication is done through Redis ). Imagine the following task , CreateUser, with the following steps:

&amp;#x200B;

\- verify\_registration\_data

\- import\_existing\_data

\- normalize\_imported\_data

\- send\_onboarding\_email

&amp;#x200B;

Those tasks will be executed sequentially, starting with the verify\_registration\_data one, however, in some of the existing tasks, based on some condition, you could jump a few steps. The pattern employed throughout the system is that usually 

the current step of the job will queue execution of the next step, with some arguments, so you could think of it like the output of a specific step in the job plan, becomes the input of the next step.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine that for example step2 might download some data ( let's say a JSON file ) , and add some ""metadata"" fields, and it would need to pass it to the next step in the task. Because job steps might not be executed on the same worker, we usually upload the files to S3, and then the next step in the list will receive a URL which it would need to download. This pattern repeats in many jobs, and it adds up to quite a lot of time spent upload/downloading files.

&amp;#x200B;

I was toying with the idea of perhaps adding some kind of intermediate service and have all uploads/downloads pass through it, and have it running on each of the worker machine, and whenever I upload/download something through this 3rd service, broadcast a message so that all ""cache services"" would grab a copy, which they would keep in RAM, in order to be able to serve it faster. This, however will open up the door to possible race conditions and possibly difficult  cache invalidations. I thought also about saving those files in redis, but it would fill up redis really quick.

I'm a PHP developer and I cannot shake the notion that I'm 'not a proper developer' because that's all I've really known outside a bit of Android development a few years ago. I'm surrounded by people with grounding in C/C++... even Perl, and I feel like they understand the world of development more for it.

My development history starts with Bash, learning the basic constructs and writing text adventure games.

I then started with raw PHP and connecting to databases, and build a laughable but functional e-commerce website from scratch in two weeks without a single line of JavaScript. 

I did some C# and Java programming for game development which I absolutely loved but went nowhere. I had a blast though, but it was only ever squares moving on other squares. I can't draw to save my life.

I moved on to Android development where I built an app that my former workplace then stole to redevelop with a third party for a six figure sum.

I finally took the plunge and went for an entry level service job in IT working with WordPress, rose through the ranks over five years and became the senior developer there.

I am now designing and building APIs and engines in Laravel in a rising company in the telephony sector.

But I still feel like an amateur - I couldn't contribute to Linux, or write a system application. I know only what malloc stands for. 

The answer is learn C or something, but the industry seems to be all over the place! Where do I start to try and learn something not based around a website? What should I do?

Now, from a development perspective, I'm really curious as to how Mystro can interact with Uber and lyft apps and get the ride information, and even accept the rides and start navigation and know when the driver is in a ride or looking for one etc. I know you can navigate between apps but how do you basically control one from another app in android?

Part of out process is to take these CV’s and format them into our own company format. The reasons behind this is that clients constantly receive CV’s in a familiar format, creating some brand familiarity. 

We also do this to remove candidate’s private information and unrelated information.

Other reasons are that candidates will sometimes put their oldest work experience first, causing clients to have to scroll to the bottom of the document to find the latest and most relevant experience.

Candidates may also include education before work experience. 
There are a few other reasons we do this.

The problem: This is a lot of admin work and the amount of variation in CV's means I can't think of any possible way that we can automate this process and thus why I am here asking the question.

Is there any way to automate even part of this process to make it faster and cut down on the admin work.

141,141,bre90c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/bre90c/horrible_coworker/,Horrible co-worker,"I am wondering how you guys feel about this.

I joined a startup about 6 months ago. Basically the team consisted of one front-end and one back-end developer. The front-end developer is sloppy. But the back-end developer is overall very precise in everything he does. He has written a significant amount of integration testing and unit testing.

Although I have noticed if my way of thinking even slightly deviates from his, he goes to publicly humiliate me on the company's group chat channel rather than just talking to me in private about it. Sometimes he just wants me to completely redo things.

If I happen to make a mistake or write a small bug in my code which wasn't covered by a test, he just goes to read my code and tries to find mistakes for the next hour or so, to complain about them in public.

Since we're using Skype and my machine only has 8GB of RAM, I installed the UWP version of Skype, because it uses less RAM, so it basically sits in my system tray. However, if I don't reply within 5 minutes, he goes to complain again. Which is incredibly hard to do if you're being concentrated and working on a second monitor. Then you're often missing the pop ups if any. Sometimes messages don't even come through.

Not to mention 8GB of RAM for Visual Studio 2017 with Resharper is not enough for web development. I'm always hovering around 85% or so when programming. But when I build or run tests, my machine is unresponsive during testing.

Then there is my boss, who promised me a company car, I asked for a budget and was promised a rental car provided when starting. When I started, there was no car, I had to book it myself, and they'd refund me. 6 months later, I am still advancing the rental car. Usually he never replies to e-mails at all. Then tells me I lack communication skills, while I'm continuously giving my team mates or him updates about work being finished.

My boss is also basically obsessed with following every commit or CI build that happens, so even if I don't say anything he will know what is done, despite him not being a programmer.

I've been proactively refactoring code, and rewriting it while working in certain modules for an assignment, then I'm told in my performance reviews that I don't seem to care about anything. I took the job because I wanted to do it, not because of the fact it pays well or has great benefits. I am in fact underpaid and have no benefits. But it's a niche industry, it was that or nothing.

I've made countless suggestions to improve the infrastructure or deployments, but they never seem to care.

On Friday, I fixed a critical bug, I asked if I was allowed to deploy, I was told no. Then on Monday I am insulted for the fact I did not deploy a new version, because of its importance.

Is it time for a change?",12,16,2019-05-21 14:49:43

An example of this is where every node gets a input from every node above it and then comes up with its own output to the entire process but compares it with other nodes in the same layer to decide which is the correct output. This process would continue until it gets through all of the node layers and finally releases with a matrix of outputs from the final node/neural network.

Edit (Pasted comment): Yes, but I’m thinking of it more on in how are brains work. Where neurons can process information individually and then communicate with other neurons to come up with a solution. And then us as individuals bounce ideas off each other to solve issues. See the human race learns collectively on different layers of abstraction. Are neurons process information and then communicate which what’s make us, and then each of us communicate to progress the human race forward. So my question is if we could simulate these layer of abstractions to where eventually the neural net could teach its self by comparing ideas with other neural nets working on the same problem from a different angle?

I work part-time for a company that has used an old-school Lynx-based terminal for remote data entry for presumably many years, I'm assuming since at least the 80's. It's not great, but worked okay once you figured out how to use it.


Recently they decided to update it to a web-based version, and instantly said everyone has to start using this new version ASAP, with the max time limit to do so being by this weekend.


I finally started using it tonight and I was curious about the `.faces` extension as I've never heard of it, which is kinda weird as I'm a nerd and look up junk about web dev and related languages &amp; technologies which I have no intention of ever using. JSF doesn't seem to be capable of doing anything better than could be done without it, and in fact seems to make many things more difficult just because of bad design decisions.


So, is JSF actually maturing and becoming a reasonable, useful tool, and worth using instead of something like HTML/CSS/JS with modern libraries which easily could've served the same purpose and likely worked far better?


The one good thing I've found so far is the use of MomentJS, but they're even doing that improperly with deprecated methods that throw console messages. They are also using synchronous XMLHTTPRequest for nearly-constant state updates from the server...lol. So, whereas we used to be able to type nearly-constantly and the terminal buffer would allow it to keep up, now we have to wait for it after entering most pieces of data before we can type the next.


The only reason I can consider that they would want it done this way would be to hide much of the possibly-sensitive parts of the server side information, but then I still don't understand why JSF would be an acceptable technology unless they just didn't bother to pay any attention to what was going to be used because they're too lazy, or incompetent, or don't understand programming/technology -- all things that should cause them to be fired, or at least moved to a different job within the company.


Also, dev tools are still perfectly accessible because it's just a webpage that we connect to, so it's not like someone can't just look at the network traffic to easily see the server address without even needing WireShark/etc, along with the page source. So, they're not hiding a whole lot or at least not doing so well, if that was actually the intention.


----


My impression is that they were scammed by a lowest-quote dev who wanted to do an experiment or uses projects like this to extort companies, but they've spent so much they now feel they have to push it, and because of that everyone who uses their data entry system is getting punished.


Pretty sure the turnover rate on this job is about to skyrocket; maybe then they'll consider reverting to the old school way again? Lol.


Edit: this is at least the third time it just ""didn't work"" (sits and spins trying to connect, IDC enough to try to debug it for the idiots) already since we've started using it. That only happened a handful of times over **years** with the legacy system. Modernization my ass; I'm officially considering this a scam or the company trying to take itself out/run off the data entry section of the company by making us deal with this pile of trash.",10,3,2019-05-01 03:45:51

1. Oops, I forgot to write certain code for this, and it's broken

3. I just wrote bad code, this is broken, and this needs to be rethought and redone
4. This is a problem, but the code isn't wrong or bad and changing it would break things, so I'll have to add new code to override/supplement the current code for this type of scenario
5. This edge-case, unusual scenario never came up and is broken, so I'll write new code just for that one situation
6. That isn't exactly a bug, nothing is broken, and this isn't a radical new feature-request, but in retrospect it's really something I should've included from the beginning

&amp;#x200B;

    $row = 1;
    $resultArray = [];
    if (($handle = fopen(""relics.csv"", ""r"")) !== FALSE) {
     while (($data = fgetcsv($handle)) !== FALSE) {
         $resultArray[] = $data;
         $row++;
     }     
     fclose($handle); 
    }

 

    if(count($resultArray)&gt;0){
     for($i=0;$i&lt;count($resultArray);$i++){
         echo '&lt;p&gt;Item: '.$resultArray[$i][0].'&lt;/p&gt;';         
        echo '&lt;p&gt;Description: '.$resultArray[$i][1].'&lt;/p&gt;';         
        echo '&lt;p&gt;Type: '.$resultArray[$i][2].'&lt;/p&gt;'; } }

However, I am not too sure how to implement this into my code. I believe this is php, but again I am not too sure how to use this. I have 233 rows in my spreadsheet, so do I put this number in the brackets of $resultArray?

&amp;#x200B;

I want the solution to be able to link the information from my spreadsheet into my HTML without spending an immense amount of time copy and pasting 233 items.

This probably involved learning the chips instruction set and how to write programs, get them to run on the computer and most importantly how to trace errors.

I really cannot imagine how this is accomplished. I tried learning Microsoft Macro Assembler and got some things to work but without a proper IDE would not know how to compile and run source code.

Then, of course there's compiled languages, the first commerical one - I think - was the Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Language. How where compilers installed? Nowaday's I just tell my machine to grab GCC off the web.

It searches a txt file containing x number of IDs, and then uses curl to call the API and plugs in the IDs from the text file. I'm using jq to extract a specific part of the JSON into a spreadsheet.

Ultimately, what I'm wanting to do is to write a simple UI that interacts with that same API to extract various fields from the JSON.

My vision is a box for either a single ID, or multiple, and checkboxes for the available fields, that can be checked based on what all is needed. Then, it would dump the data into a spreadsheet with columns for ID, and then whichever fields were extracted.

How easy is this to do for someone with little to no C# experience? I know there is a webrequest class - beyond that, I'm clueless.

Below is the script I wrote which worked beautifully:

    for ID in $(cat IDlist.txt); do echo -n $ID,; curl -s -X GET $(echo ""https://url/api/Retrieve/$ID/DisplayInfo"") -H  ""accept: application/json"" -H  ""ApiKey: apikey"" | jq .field; done &gt; fields.txt",3,1,2019-05-01 15:35:46

In each theme park you have to have a picture, description, name, fees, hours, an EditText to say how many tickets you wish to buy, and a purchase ticket button that displays your total for how many tickets you purchased.

&amp;#x200B;

Well on my initialize for my purchase tickets button I am getting a null pointer exception error on bold and italics line:

number\_of\_tickets = findViewById(R.id.*get\_text*);

ticketPrice = findViewById(R.id.*total\_textBox*);

mPurchaseButtonAnnoying = findViewById(R.id.*purchase\_button\_annoying*);

***mPurchaseButtonAnnoying.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {    (This line)***

Each recursive function call creates a new stack frame. Different chess positions have a different number of legal moves, and so each stack frame should ideally be of different size/offset.

I have tried storing moves in heap memory and as expected, this is slower than storing moves in fixed size arrays (no chess position has more than 216 moves). Few chess positions have as many as 216 moves and so this strategy clogs up the CPU caches with null moves.

In fact, there were many installations in which the task of sorting was responsible for more than half of the computing time.""  


What do computers nowadays spend their time doing? in relation to algorithms you might study. As in 3-sat solvers are really good now. And work on them is important. But I doubt the total time spent solving 3-sat is a big % of all computation. Game rendering by GPUs would seem to be a big chunk of all computations.

I have:

    abstract class Operation{}

Some interface for processing instances of those classses as follows:

    interface IHandler&lt;in T&gt;
        where T: A
    {
    void Calculate(T operation) {}
    }

Then i want to have some classes for calculating those operations as follows:

    class OperationBHandler: IHandler&lt;OperationB&gt;
    {
        void Calculate(OperationB operation) {}
    }

Everything alright, now I want to have some service which will take collection of those operations, take handler and calculate this operation. First thing i wanna do is to register those handlers in dictionary so this service looks kinda like this:

    class Service 
    {
        Dictionary&lt;Type, IHandler&lt;OperationA&gt; dict = new ...
        Service()
        {

        }
    }

Now when i take operation and want to retreive handler from dictionary

    dict[operation.GetType()]

I get null, I guess its becouse i cannot cast Activator.CreateInstance&lt;OperationBHandler&gt;() to IHandler&lt;OperationA&gt;.

I tried some different approaches but every each of them gave me complilation errors and i guess im missing something?

Can someone point me direction? Thanks in advance.",5,1,2019-06-06 16:28:45

But we didn't exactly Go into insane amount of detail and wrote very huge programs we just did standalone stuff .  
So the question : Do you think it would be better for me to finish learning this language fully and start coding in it and maybe make a small program / Do a project I know i am very far away from that point with the current knowledge I have **OR** Because I know at the end of the day [VB.net](https://VB.net) isn't in demand that much and Python is more widely used ( I also have interest for ML ) and accepted in the programming community should i Just discard my Initial work of [VB.net](https://VB.net) and just start with Python and learn from this basic level I am at to the level I want to reach in python   


 (I hope this isn't too confusing I am basically worried If me switching to python halfway in the process of learning [VB.net](https://VB.net) will mess up my programming Concepts / get me confused as I know different languages have differences as [VB.net](https://VB.net) is my first language and I haven't learned it fully yet .

&amp;#x200B;

For example, Formula 1 allows for people to watch micro-sectors timings, weather, tyres, positions and so on ON REAL TIME.

I know their cars and sensor around the track are basically an utopia regarding IoT. I assume they run a server collecting data, and output a video feed in real-time. And this part I understand, I've worked with IoT and low-level data collecting and measurements.

&amp;#x200B;

The data processing and video rendering. This is what is magical for me, and I haven't succeeded on finding how it works exactly.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to work on something like that, maybe on open-source projects. I find it amazing and I believe I could give time and do a nice work on it, creating animations and so on. I would like to start.

But I don't want to start and make something useless. I would like to start by analysing current industry standards, like softwares that do this kind of stuff (e.g. receive X data, display Y on video), but how does it work at the moment? Is it an enterprise software, Adobe Premiere style, with customizable templates without need for programmers, and so on? Or is it all raw C/C++, custom-made video rendering? Or a mix of both? How exactly the data interfaces with the video rendering?

&amp;#x200B;

Are there standards for it? Known softwares and tech? I could say nowdays the most common APIs are RESTful-based, but how about this? Please enlighten me.

Also, are there open-source projects that this kind of software uses, so I could contribute?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: How does the software(s) behind a real-time video like [this](https://i.imgur.com/e9V9Spk.jpg) work, interface each-other and what are the standards?

I have built quite a few full stack apps using Node js. I have mostly been using Firebase (firestore,cloud functions), coming from a mostly front end background this was an easier way for me to dive into backend services. Most of my projects required a few api calls here and there, authentication, small data storage. Now I am having to deal with larger amounts of data, on what I would call more legacy systems. An example would be calling an endpoint that returns a 3mb XML payload, and using that to sync an inventory on another database. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I am having is with my server memory limits and how to handle large requests to limit the amount of timeouts. Since the data I am calling is dynamic I do not believe I can cache the data. My questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

* What are the best practices for handling data like this? Is there a difference between say, getting the data and writing to a file on my server, and using that to perform my logic? Or is storing the data in memory perform the same? 
* Is Firebase just not a good idea for this situation? Cloud functions can have a max of 2gb for its memory",7,2,2019-06-15 11:55:05

Coming straight to the problem, let's say there are two peers A and B. Now, let's analyze the scenario:

1. A requests a file from B.
2. B calculates the checksum of the file.
3. B starts sending the file to A in chunks, but sends the file metadata (which has the checksum of the file from 2. among other things) in the first chunk itself.
4. A reads the stream of chunks and on EOF, eventually receives the entire file.
5. A calculates its checksum and verifies if it's the same as that sent from B.
6. Everyone's happy.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the happy path.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem occurs between step 2 and 3. Let's say the file of interest to A is a text file. Now, just after step 2, let's say B makes an edit to the file. This poses a lot of problems, but the basic one to address is the fact that the checksum on the receiver node doesn't match anymore. As you can see, the problem is a lot worse if B changes the file once the streaming of chunks has begun.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I did think of a few ways to address this issue:

1. Acquire a write lock on the file immediately after step 1. But, this has to be an OS-level lock to ensure that no other process on the machine can make any changes to it. Not sure if this is complicating things a little too much.
2. Copy the file to a temporary folder and do the actual file transfer from the temporary location. There's an obvious issue here with large files, and also the added overhead of additional disk space requirement. Not something I want to do.

I have zero programming knowledge and I am looking to see if something is possible.

[RSVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_serial_visual_presentation) is a way to speed up reading rate and increase attention.  In short, it displays one word at a time in the same spot on the screen so your eyes do not need to move word to word to read. This can increase your reading speed without losing retention rate. Plus, it would stop me from answering a card based on having become familiar with the shape of the text and placement of the cloze statement.

[Here is an example of what that looks like.](https://www.spreeder.com/app.php)

I study through anki, and anything to improve my study rate would be great! Since anki allows a user to format cards with html or css, I am hoping there is some way to apply this idea to card types.

I have no ability to code, so I did some googling. So far I have found that if I throw some 'typewriter' code into the field portion of an anki card, it works. This makes me wonder if there is code to get the words to display one at a time in the center, and then display the complete statement once done.

My application is using the Node AWS SDK as to upload images to Binary Object Storage. I have built an Adapter, called `FileCRUDOperationsAdapter` as a wrapper around the AWS API that permits me to define my own interface for uploading files for the rest of my application to use.

At one part of my application, images are received from the client in a particular format. I need to do a lot of pre-processing on those images (such as transforming their object properties, resizing them, manipulating the buffers, etc.) prior to using my Adapter to upload them to AWS S3.

Is this the correct use case for implementing a Proxy or Decorator Pattern around the Adapter, or are there better methods to do it - such as just creating a service class that does the work to prepare the images, and then pass those off to the Adapter.

I'm also using Test Driven Development, so I need all implementations to be testable.

And i can google my way through anything. I want to build a program that will be a bit more complex than anything i done before. Figured i could ask this group what language they think i should try it with.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of the program will be to have a user be able take an image, a schematic. Then create boxes around valves and switches and defines them into a table. Then a logic filter created by the user and saved. Later on the user can select created logic filters and display it over the schematic.

&amp;#x200B;

An example would be is....

User uploads a picture. Highlights a section around a switch and labels it as S1; highlights valve 1, valve 2, etc... and calls them V1, V2, etc.....

Then can create another table for various groupings... IF SW2 is on; then V4 is ON and V2 is OFF. And make several more of these

Based on the table selected and the output, the diagram would highlight the boxes on the image with a color coding system. Like the SW could be yellow, ON valves would be green, and OFF valves would be red or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this makes sense.

I have done a bit of programming with c++, HTML and SQL. And a tiny bit with python and java. So with that mix i was thinking a JAVA type GUI and SQL DB to hold the logic tables was my first idea. But i am sure someone here may have a better solution for the noobie who is just screwing around.

I'm writing a plugin for AviSynth which needs to draw on an existing array of bytes as if it were a graphics context/render target. With GDI+ I can do this:

	Bitmap bitmap(width, height, pitch, PixelFormat24bppRGB, pointer_to_bytes);
	Graphics* g = Graphics::FromImage(&amp;bitmap);

And from then on I can use GDI+ commands to paint on the bitmap.

I'm trying to do the same thing with Direct2D, but I just can't get anywhere. The best I can find are pages that give examples of how to fulfil a WM_PAINT message using Direct2D, but then add a tiny note ""Oh and you can also point to a bitmap, if you want,"" without going into any detail as to how.

I can create my Direct2D resources without a problem - factory, render target, brush - and thought I could do this:

	const RECT a = { 0, 0, width, height };
	hr = render_target-&gt;BindDC(g-&gt;GetHDC(), &amp;a);

where g is the `Graphics*` from above. But BindDC returns a ""The parameter is incorrect"" error. I also tried:

	ID2D1Bitmap* d2d_bitmap;
	hr = render_target-&gt;CreateBitmap(D2D1_SIZE_U({ (UINT32)width, (UINT32)height }), pointer_to_bytes, (UINT32)pitch, D2D1_BITMAP_PROPERTIES({ D2D1_PIXEL_FORMAT({DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM_SRGB, D2D1_ALPHA_MODE_UNKNOWN}), 90.0f, 90.f }), &amp;d2d_bitmap);

But that gives an error result which ERRLOOK.EXE can't translate, unhelpfully.

I'm writing a card game that is played through a console window. For the sake of simplicity, let's consider that there is 1 human player and 3 computer players.

I could just simply run a few conditional checks that dictate what the computer players do, which abide by the rules of the game, and just use an RNG on exactly which playable card to use. But I want more granularity than that.

For the computer players, I want to assign their difficulty (dummy, competent, advanced).

When it comes to differentiating between each players actions and their tendency to be either aggressive in their decisions or more passive, how would I integrate that into the computer players? How are decisions weighted and what dictates how choices are reached by the computer players? I would imagine a decision tree is used but I'm not familiar with anything in this particular area, so I don't know how to approach this or the correct terminology to research it.

Tell me if this makes sense: assign an integer value to card objects with certain cards having a higher value than others (lower values for regular cards, higher values for cards that affect other players negatively). Each player difficulty has a numerical preference which is used to determine what card to play when there is more than 1 that is playable.

    updateUsingKeyStatus(e) {
                    if (0 !== e.location)
                        return;

I like to use lambdas instead of passing an anonymous class as a parameter to a method.

Our senior hates our approach because, in his opinion, breaks code consistency. 

We are designing new endpoints and usually the senior's handler only has a single method of 200+ lines. He also doesn't use lambdas. 

We feel that we aren't breaking code consistency and that he is being to uptight and protective of his code but since we have little work experience, we aren't sure if we are reading the situation correctly.

Then they told me that I won't be allowed to use the internet while working on the project. This wasn't discussed before. Sure, I am very good at what I do, but I don't think I can do this. I use the internet a lot. I never really cared about memorizing stuff, since if you know how to look, everything is one google away. I told them at least whitelist some specific websites (stackoverflow, documentation for the frameworks I will be using), and they refused.

about a year ago I wrote an x86 (yes, the 32-bit one) operating system from scratch and it was a lot of fun.

Now, I am thinking of repeating the exercise, but for an ARM device. I have mostly worked on the Intel side, so I have very limited expertise on even the lingo of ARM, but from what little I understand, the space is much less standardized, and I am going to have to pick a target and code specifically against its hardware.

So, the question I come here for is: what's a good board that I could pick as my target device?

In no specific order, things that would make a device ""good"":

- decent documentation/datasheet on how to program the hardware;  
- not sure if this is comes standard on ARM processors, but support for memory protection, virtual memory, and some form of user/supervisor mode;  
- support for flashing via USB from a development host;  
- tools and compilers usable from Linux (if I could get a decently modern GCC or clang, it would be awesome);  
- I don't really need a screen, nor do I care about being able to plug a keyboard via USB, interacting with the system via UART is plenty fine;  
- I don't care about having a ""disk"" either, but I would definitely like for tasks to be able to save/load data from some kind of storage, even if it's just a small area of non-volatile storage on-board;  
- I would like to be able to schedule tasks for a quantum and preempt, and am not sure if all ARM boards come with a clock built-in, so thought I would mention a clock capable of raising an interrupt is strongly desirable;  
- I don't really care for floating-point, it would be cute but I can live with integer only;  
- in a similar vein, if the board came with a few sensors (e.g. accel, gyro) that would be cute, but I see enough sensors in my day job, so I can do without programming yet another BMI160;  

Does anyone have any recommendations in this space? Thanks in advance for helping!",3,2,2019-06-21 20:46:13

After years of using JavaScript, I decided to switch to C#. Why not? C# has strict types while JavaScript has no types. Everything is just `var`. I wish I can say this \`var\` is a string or an int, but it doesn't. Maybe my problem is that JS is a scripting language and C# is a programming language. Idk the difference.

TypeScript?

Let me just say that I freakin LOVED TypeScript. Data Types, classes, OOP, perfect! But there's one problem... debugging. I use a debugger, like in the web browser or in VS Code, and I try to evaluate `this` but it's JS compiled variable is `_this.` Even other variables I use get renamed a lot. And I swear, I turned on JS Mapping but many times, the lines don't match with each other. This was in an Angular project.

That's when I realized JS isn't worth it. I switched to JS because it's great to use one language in front and back end, and coding is really fast. But it's not worth losing data types and debugging benefits. From a developer perspective, I think JS is not worth it... yet it's one of the most popular languages ever. So I switched to C# and I've been a bit happer. (I only say ""a bit"" because Microsoft is annoying sometimes.)

I'm trying to make a hard choice, that's why I'm asking for help. 

For like 2 years i've been programming in Java, mainly webapps using Spring. (I should say i've been learning programming since i'm still at school). Recently, i've moved to .Net and i intend to develop an [asp.net](https://asp.net) web app. (At least i'll try to). Also i'd like to try some mobile app for my device, that should be useful for me. Nothing so big.

Thus comes my question -- what would be a better choice when developing a mobile app? I like Java quiet much, but since i've benn writing in c# that language appeals to me more. Also i have not so good memories with programming in android studio. A year ago i and my friends parcitipaded in a hackathon trying to create something interesting for mobiles, and the work with android studio was just a pain in the neck. There were a lot of bugs, the development process was so clumsy (Maybe we were just to inexperienced in this kind of work, but since then i got some kind of trauma connected to working in that IDE). But as i use c# more, Java is getting a little bit to heavy for me. (Though i still like that language). I've watched mosh video about Xamarin: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ZU6j59wL4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ZU6j59wL4)

And this is much faster to develop than my first lines of code using Java were.  
Though, having read some opinions on xamarin vs. native i'm uncertain, what i should choose.

So, basically my question: What are pros and cons of programming with Xamarin and with native libraries? What would be better for a beginner?  
If you could, would you give me some advice on mobile development? And also, i'd appreciate recommending some tutorials (Whether they're free or not).

The three objects of what I (the lab wants) want to achieve are:

&amp;#x200B;

1) **Navigation within a building.** The lab lead explained that we would upload a virtual map into our hololens so that if we say ""Take me Professor's \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ office"" a virtual assistant will lead me there without clipping walls and such.

2) **Reading a poster image/text and allowing further search.** If I have a picture of a whale, could say ""Let me see more"" and see more images of whales.

3) **Navigation with Google maps.** Same idea as one but with Google Maps (API?)

I'm not entirely sure why that as. I thought that maybe Ruby's meta-programming features might play a role in allowing developers to do more with less code. Most of the frameworks I've tried have required a ton of boilerplate to do the same things that Rails would allow me to do with ease.

(heavy CPU load),"**TL/DR:**  Heavy procedural-generation on a dedicated, sharded MMO server for my new game.  Client is TCP via Unity C#. Play as server already made in Unity C#. What language has the best performance/scalability for a headless TCP server?  Not afraid of learning a new language, but it needs to be the ""best overall."" 

&amp;#x200B;

***CPU performance per thread and ease of multi-threaded programming is very important!***

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all,

I'm working on a new, procedural-generation-heavy game that will be single-player/multi-player/MMO.  For the single-player/multi-player part, I'm using Unity and [Telepathy](https://github.com/vis2k/Telepathy) (C# TCP networking).  It's taken a while for Unity/C# to grow on me, but I feel fairly productive in that environment now.

&amp;#x200B;

However, it's clear that for my game to really take off, I'll need to take the dedicated server/MMO bit very seriously, and using Unity for a headless server makes little sense.  Since each world is procedurally generated, the CPU load of the dedicated server(s) will be extremely high, and if I have 60+ worlds running at once in the game universe, that's some serious multi-threaded execution/optimization.  Each world is almost entirely self-contained, so communication between worlds will be very low, but doing send-new-procedural-terrain-chunks and procedural-action-validity-checks on 20 players per world is pretty significant. I'm willing to throw as much server horsepower as I can at the problem, but choosing the most performant multi-threaded language is a priority in order to save execution time &amp; server energy.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my programming background:

I started programming in Borland C.  Dabbled in C++ and was forced to make a few webapps in Java. Learned MIPS and 8086 assembly. CPU dense apps in MATLAB &amp; C.  I had to learn LabVIEW and wrote a few large (500k lines) apps with it.   Some of it was lightning fast.  Because multi-threading in LabVIEW is super easy to do, my C equivalent code was close but never as fast.  Then Python for 4 years of work, which was irritating but necessary.  Maintained some awful legacy Javascript+VB.NET+C# code.  Now dabbling in Unity C#, which has slowly grown on me.

&amp;#x200B;

While LabVIEW would be the quickest thing for me to use to get a multi-threaded, CPU-intense, dedicated server off the ground, there's got to be a better option, especially if I ever want someone else to work on it.  I'm not afraid of learning a new language, but I need to be convinced that it's the optimal choice if I'm going to go down that rabbit hole, hence this post.  I'm not one to learn new languages just for the fun of it.

6,6,cikg2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/cikg2a/is_there_a_name_for_this_design_goal/,Is there a name for this design goal?,"In computer engineering, there's the famous goal of ""scalability"". But that's mostly for performance; it refers to a system's ability to accommodate a higher workload with linear scaling of costs. 

Is there a name for the design goal of scalability, but from the programmer's perspective (sort of)? Basically, the goal of designing the skeleton of a system such that when a programmer works on any given part, they don't have to think about the bigger picture and how *everything* connects together, and they can focus all their energy on their little portion. 

I'm familiar with the design goal of modularity, but I think I'm speaking of something slightly different. There are systems that satisfy my property, but I wouldn't describe as ""modular"", necessarily. Some examples:

- Academic papers. Academics don't need to think about how their work fits into the bigger picture of human knowledge. They can just submit their paper to the correct journals, and their paper will get incorporated into the proper place within our collective knowledge automatically. 
- Wikipedia. Volunteers don't have to think about how their edits will impact the entirety of Wikipedia, despite the fact that at any one point in time, ""Wikipedia"" is just some set of articles, and they are changing that state. They don't need to think about policy guidelines or whatever---as long as they're editing with good intentions, everything will self correct. 

The idea I'm trying to capture here is a system that has a lot of entities working on it together, but is carefully designed so that the workers can focus as much energy as possible on their work, and not how the system fits together, for the system to be successful. 

This is obviously more general than programming, but I'm asking it here because I tend to get the best answers from here. 

It's not modularity, because that's more a property of what the system looks like (it has modules) than what it's able to do. It's not ""self correcting"", because that doesn't capture the notion of making the collective effort sum together in an efficient way. Maybe ""efficient""? But that means many things. 

Sorry for the long post. Also, reading this again I realize this perhaps isn't the most clear, so please ask me for clarifications as to what I'm trying to say.",8,6,2019-07-27 13:40:48

I'm moving from C to C++, writing a simple chess engine as a first project, in XCode. Running into a bug I've got no idea how to fix. I consider myself a good C programmer and I have a good handle on stack frames and where most data lives in memory in a C program, however I have very little understanding of all the various constructors that C++ offers or how &amp; when they allocate memory.

I have a breakpoint on the constructor in the second image, set to the condition that (r &lt; 0 || r &gt; 7 || c &lt; 0 || c &gt; 7), since the oob (out of bounds) member seems to be getting set incorrectly. I hit the breakpoint, and the debugger showed both r and c as having the value 0 but being greater than 7. I added a new expression ""r"" to the variable view window and this time it showed up as a large (seemingly random?) value. Using ""view memory"" on either of the ""r"" expressions in that window shows me the same pointer to the same chunk of memory.

The nonzero value of r has no zeroed bytes so it doesn't seem to be an endian or word-size issue. My best guess is it's some complication of C++'s member initialization that I don't understand.

But the actual SetCurrentBehaviour method is the same for all animals. Is it somehow possibly to through polymorphism change the type requirement so that this is enforced? In the AnimalBaseClass it should the SetCurrentBehaviour

in Reptile it should be SetCurrentBehaviour and in Mammals SetCurrentBehaviour

The output will be an array containing detected lane lines as shapes and each lane line has an array of points. The question now is how to I create the logic to be able to determine the labelling of the lines. e.g. leftleft, left, middle(lane changing scenarios), right, rightright. The output lines are not in order so based on the x,y coordinates of the few lines I have to determine which line is which. The program can detect a maximum of 5 lines as I stated the naming above. If no lane change 4 lines maximum. Thank you.",0,1,2019-07-05 02:22:09

Hey all.

I am a supervisor of a rather large company. We require scheduling all individuals into their respective places otherwise it could lead to shortages.

I want to make a user management program, or an automated scheduler. The goal of the project is to track where a user is in their training.

**Example**

1. User 1 can make pencils
2. User 2 can make pencils, and pens
3. User 3 can make pencil, pens, and can assemble staplers.
4. User 4 is a trainer, but can also do all of the above.
5. User 5 is a team lead, trainer, and can do all of the above.

The programs job would be to organize the users and place them in the best possible spot with a goal of everything being covered, but also maximizing training. For example, if the program sees an opportunity to train a User 1 to a User 2 it could assign a User 4 to be with the User 1.

What I need is a good programming language to go off for this. I am checking out JavaScript, Python, and C++. I'm not sure what would be the best one though. Guidance would be appreciative!

I have the task to create a daemon application which should use Microsoft Graph Ressources. I have used MSGraph before but done so using various Client Libraries provided by Microsoft. This time I need to use a java based Code Generator ([Talend](https://de.talend.com/products/application-integration/esb-open-studio/?utm_campaign=DE%20Search%20-%20Branded%20-%20TOS%20%28German%29&amp;utm_content=talend%20open%20studio%20-%20epmb&amp;utm_creative=237896774635&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_term=talend%20open%20studio)) and I cannot use these libraries.

&amp;#x200B;

I've started to read the documentation around it and am now trying to get an access token for my application. I want to test my requests using Insomnia REST Client. I came across the follwing documentation which should elaborate of how such a request is made up:

&amp;#x200B;

 `POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1 Host: login.microsoftonline.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

`&amp;scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2F.default` 

`&amp;client_secret=qWgdYAmab0YSkuL1qKv5bPX` 

`&amp;grant_type=client_credentials` 

&amp;#x200B;

See the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-service#4-get-an-access-token).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't get how to send this request, I have only used requests that used paramters in the endpoint string as well as headers for content and accept types. What are the other paramters?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how I understand it:

&amp;#x200B;

* URI Endpoint
* Header (Type)
* Body Value (client\_id)
* Body Value (scope)
* Body Value (client\_secret)
* Body Value (grant\_type)

&amp;#x200B;

I understand what these parameters mean but I don't get how to send the request - as I'm pretty new to this sort of thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I typed it that way in insomnia but I don't get a response. Can anyone offer some explanation here?

Now what does something like this mean `http://ftp.example.com`? Does it mean that we are trying to send files using `ftp` **over** `http` protocol via a web-browser? Isn't that kind of overkill. `ftp` is an application layer protocol so sending it over `http` which is also an application layer protocol will hamper performance.


I haven't used `ftp` much, but whatever I have used, I have done it via a terminal with commands like these -

```bash
ftp user@ftpdomain.com
OR
ftp user@192.168.0.5
```

**TLDR:** what is the difference between `ftp://ftp.adobe.com` and (say (this doesn't exist, firefox gives unsafe warning)) `http://ftp.adobe.com`.

I just want a modern take, what tools would you be looking at with these requirements in mind?

The CMS side must be able to create news or blog-like articles with listing pages and individual article pages.

Some things that combine commerce needs with CMS-like features is the ability to include a slideshow / gallery type widget showing photos of the product from different angles. Plus of course a products listing page, tagged or otherwise categorized.

The store would be selling physical products with shipping requirements. Preferably the solution works with USPS and Square, but other ideas might be fine if the other requirements are good.

And for preference, I like RAD or very high level tools but where I can also dig lower level if needed to change things (without hacking any third party software). I'm fine with opinionated stacks, as long as they're somewhat customizable or ones that have an opinion on something by default and can be changed. As for language I'm fine with nearly anything but would like to not work in PHP if that can be avoided.",3,2,2019-07-19 13:23:57

Still relatively new at programming, I was just wondering if there's a way to do this that's not too difficult to implement!

Situation: I have two aerial drone images overlooking my stream in my backyard -- one taken from today and one taken from a week before. The images of the stream change slightly from today and last week: the image from today is larger in size (more pixels) because it was flown at a slightly different height and the picture also captured a bit more area than a week ago. However both images are both oriented in the same direction (e.g. facing north), and are looking straight down from a birds eye view.

I would like to overlay a grid on the images in the exact same places as the first week as the second week (to see how certain areas around the stream have changed), but I run into issues because the size of the image is slightly different and captures different areas. (The grid is made to line up with last week's image perfectly, but when pasted over the other image it of course will not capture the same area

Any thoughts? I tried to overlay a cyan colored pixel in the top left corner of both today's image and overlaid a cyan color pixel on the second image in pretty close to the same area (used them as 'markers'), had my program search for the cyan colored pixel and paste the grid on the image there, but that didn't work -- the corner of the grid matched up, but none of the boxes encompassed the same area and didn't stretch to the full image",2,5,2019-07-19 13:56:18

I'm building an app for which it would be extremely useful to have a database that I can call on constantly that would have a giant list of all/almost all geotagged photos in Flickr. I don't need the actual photos, just the metadata associated with them.

Flickr's API obviously limits this in a few ways. They won't return more than 4,000 photos in one call, then to actually get the GPS data for each of those photos takes one call per photo.

My immediate instinct is to just set up a python script that runs on a timer and gradually grabs all the two million or so photos. Once all that information is local I can hit it as much as I want.

This feels like the wrong method of doing things, but I don't see any other option. One operation on my app will probably use the amalgamated data from 10k+ photos. To my eye, that would be 10k+ requests to the Flickr API, which is untenable. But it also feels like I'm doing something wrong?

I am currently in the process of writing an Excel module using VBA that will extract the first line of an address using a regular expression.

I was able to find some code online that does something similar to the intent, but instead of returning the value indicated by the regular expression, it simply blanks it and returns the other portions of the address

So for example, if the address was ""555 Main St, Washington, DC 20395"", the value returned is "", Washington, DC 20395"". 

I would like ""555 Main St"" to be returned.

Here is the code I have:

&gt;Function addressLine1(Myrange As Range) As String
&gt;
&gt;    Dim regEx As New RegExp
&gt;
&gt;    Dim strPattern As String
&gt;
&gt;    Dim strInput As String

&gt;
&gt;    If strPattern &lt;&gt; """" Then
&gt;        strInput = Myrange.Value
&gt;        strReplace = """"
&gt;
&gt;        With regEx
&gt;            .Global = True
&gt;            .MultiLine = True
&gt;            .IgnoreCase = False
&gt;            .Pattern = strPattern
&gt;        End With
&gt;
&gt;        If regEx.Test(strInput) Then
&gt;            addressLine1 = regEx.Replace(strInput, strReplace)
&gt;            Debug.Print addressLine1
&gt;        Else
&gt;            addressLine1 = ""Not matched""
&gt;        End If
&gt;    End If

&gt;End Function

I tried replacing the regEx.Replace function with regex.Execute, but this only caused ""#VALUE"" to be returned when there was a match.

I am fairly new to web programming and the last time I made a website was with plain PHP, HTML/CSS and a MySQL database. Since I want to use my next project to actually learn something and not just finish the product, I thought about a better way for displaying data on my website.

The structure I want to change looks like the following. 

&amp;#x200B;

**""Back-End""**

I have several clients (raspberry PI) that send data (temperature, humidity etc) via a PHP POST requests to my server. The script then simply saves this information in a MySQL database and also detects / registers new clients.

**""Front-End""**

I just took a bootstrap template and have several PHP scripts that interpret and display the data. This is the part that bothers me the most. It just feels really old-school and not very effective. As soon as I change something in the database everything needs to be adjusted. I would really love to just access the data via 1 or 2 lines of (functional) programming.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any idea how I could access the data in the MySQL database more effectively ? 

I am willing to completely rewrite the code and change the programming language. Are their any frameworks, languages that do a better job ? It should be as flexible as possible. Or maybe I am using PHP incorrect and there are good tutorials for this specific problem

SmartSwap is 100% decentralized, eliminates the need for trust between the parties, overcomes some of the Atomic Swap disadvantages, and is a face value exchange. It’s secure, easy to implement, protects the user against losses in case of currency rate changes and it doesn’t require blockchains involvement to have code abilities and the same Hash algorithm (like Atomic Swap does). Using SmartSwap, a user is able to exchange crypto-for-crypto without the risk, hassle or expense or volatility that exists on other cryptocurrency exchanges.

**What I consider to be the benefits of the Smart Swap functionality**

When a user needs to change one crypto for another, they must have an account on an exchange. In order to make their exchange, they must accept the best price they can find from other traders. Further, if a coin changes in value, the exchange does not adjust the trade to accommodate this; users are constantly exposed to a risk of losing in trades because of a market shift. Currently, users must watch the market to make sure that their trades are not impacted by fluctuations.

**SmartSwap improves the way in which exchanges are carried out. Currently, exchanges work in the following way:**

* At the time of creating the order the trade is BTC is valued at $4,000 and will trade for 30 ETH (\~$133 each).
* If the ETH drop value by 5% user will receive 30 ETH, but the value is now $3,800 (\~$126 each) - user lost $200.
* Or If BTC increases in value by 5% (to $4,200) the user loses this gain in the trade as they will still only receive 30 ETH (\~$133 each), the increase in value is not applied at time of trade - user has lost $200 in value in the swap.

**Exchanges on the Element zero SmartSwap, example; Trade 1 BTC to ETH:**

* At the time of creating the order the trade is BTC is valued at $4,000 and will trade for same value, $4,000 in ETH
* If ETH drops in value by 5%, the user will receive 31.578 ETH ($4,000) - same face value equal to $4,000 of BTC
* If BTC increased value +5% user will end up with 31.5 ETH (equal to $4,000) - same face value equal to $4,000

Using SmartSwap, users trade will always be exact value:value match. If the prices of either coin fluctuate by the time the trade occurs, users will still receive the exact value of their coin in the traded coin.

I have over a month of record video where the videos are in `yyyy_mm_dd_hh_mm_ss` format.   Generally the bulk of videos are from 1300 to 1700-1900 but sometimes I have a day/session that looks like

    session 20180712
    2018_07_12_17_30_00 and run to 2018_07_13_0200

Besides above I was thinking of a brute force script that looked for a session ending at `2018_07_23_59_00` and the next day/session starts at `2018_07_00_01_00`.   From there I would copy the overlap until there was a large enough gap (similar to the function above).


The video files are from a dash cam that creates a new video every minute and they're either recordings of me as a Lyft driver or more important is an annual trip I make from Denver, Colorado to Anchorage, Alaska.

I intended to make a time lapse of each ""day"" along with an animated gif tracing my path.   Unfortunately the Lyft data is absolute massive @ 3 terabytes @ 80Mb per video and it would take a long time to manually sort these.   

The GPS data isn't an issue and its fairly immaculate because I am using GNS with GLONASS, Galileo, and GPS to pin point me down to a meter accuracy (far beyond good enough).   I've converted and started graphing the position data as UTM (meters) to track distance/average speed per day.    If I can't automatically sort the data, the graphs would show obvious breaks (/ in one day `/` and then  `/_/\` spikes in the next day).",2,2,2019-07-04 11:30:32

I got stuck on a problem where it gives a function definition in algebraic form and ask to create a recursive as well as iterative approach for this problem, I was able to create recursive solution since its quite easy, maybe because we are taught recursion and give it importance, but can't quite come up with iterative solution.

If you have read this book or maybe just want to help me solve this solution. Here it is.

f(n) such that

I think I have decided what language I will use for making it. I’m thinking c++, but let me know if you know of any other that will fit better, doesn’t really matter to me what language I use, I can always find it on stackoverflow.

Second, how should I structure the code. Like how to handle it. I know that in python (I don’t want to use python for this purpose) I could make a class with functions (maybe put in some decorators to specify the syntax needed to call that functions) to handle the user defined code. So when it recognizes for example a variable declaration, it calls getattr() on that class to get the function that handles that code.

I was originally thinking of making an interpreter, but decided it was too slow. If anyone can point me to a good tutorial on making a compiler that would be great. Is it possible to write some code in c++, compile it, copy the assembly via a deassembler and use that assembly code in the final file generated with my compiler, then use a assembler(I’m not totally sure what it’s called, but it makes an executable from the assembly file) to make a runnable application.

Hello all,

recently I've picked up Skyrim again after a few years hiatus. After experimenting with the in-game alchemy an interesting question popped into my head - is it possible to create a potion with 6 effects? The answer is yes, in theory.

For those unfamiliar with Skyrim's alchemy minigame, it goes something like this;

* There is a pool of about 100 different ingredients.
* Each ingredient has 4 effects, from about 50 possible effects
* Potions/Poisons are created when 2-3 ingredients are mixed
* A Potion/Poison will be 'successful' if the ingredients mixed have at least 1 effect common to at least 2 of the mixed ingredients.

A potion with 6 effects is possible, but there are more than 160,000 possible potions. Thats too much to check manually.

How could we create a program to look at all possible combinations and results, then filter said results to show only mixtures with 6 effects?

If you have any questions please fire away.",10,5,2019-07-13 11:29:48

It doesn’t have to be terribly fancy, but I’ll definitely aim for getting whatever features I can get my hands on (like context and something that can be trained).

The majority of my project is going to be .NET, but ultimately I doubt there are many (if any) such choices there, so any language will do.

Essentially my goal to find a library that I can train a bit, has basic chatbot chatting capabilities (the more natural the better, but dumb as a post will do if I that’s all there is), and I can wrap up in another application to use for myself. I don’t intend to deploy or sell the software, it’s purely for my own use.

Oh, and cheap would be good. I don’t mind spending money in em, but a lot of these bots are priced for corporate customers, not residential. They tend to charge a whole heap of a lot of cash for stuff. $50-200 one time is fine, but I expect corporate priced stuff will be a good bit more.

Well, after thinking for a while I figured I'd do an e-reader capable of reading popular non-propietary e-book formats (EPUB, MOBI) AND properly display comics in CBR/CBZ formats. (and btw, if someone knows of an e-reader capable of displaying both, please tell me)

Ok, so here's the real issue. Where do I start? Now, I don't think I need someone actually writing code for me or anything of the sorts, but I am stumped in the sense that I really don't know where to even start.

So, I'd like ideas on suggestions on what kind of language do you think would work best for me, considering I am planning to do a cross-platform app (at least Win10 and Android) capable of touch screen controls, I eventually plan to add some form of database for user logins to store their preferences and I want to work with e-book formats and comic formats.

Besides, and probably most importantly: What kind of features would you like to see on an app such as this? If it were up to me I'd just display the book, lol, I dunno what stuff to add to it. And the UI, I might need some real help designing a proper UI, but I am just asking tips and hints from you chaps, I don't expect or want anyone to do the job for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm struggling a bit with the ""clean"" aspect in a particular area of our code.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a backend application.

So, here we have c \`PlanClient\` class, it's more of a \~\~data source\~\~ remote interface - it downloads \`Plan\`.

That downloaded \`Plan\` has wrong data mixed in it - invalid dates, invalid items.

We know how to filter out and modify the \`Plan\` so that it becomes correct.

We have to log in the database every \`Plan\` downloaded.

The \`PlanClient\` is used in several parts of the application  - the wrong should not be used and is harmful in those other parts of applicaiton.

&amp;#x200B;

We have made a class \`PlanSanitizer\` and injected it into the \`PlanClient\`.

We call its sanitize methods just before returning the sanitized \`Plan\` from \`PlanClient\`.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what we have is sort of clean: the \`PlanClient\` doesn't care about exact sanitization rules, it's just 1 line of code.

But we have concerns:

1. The client is triggering database-access. This one seems easy - it's a cross cutting concern - we do it for the logging (we actually store both the original \`Plan\` and the sanitized \`Plan\`).
2. The client is calling sanitization. Seems pecualiar - in our codebase what we call \`Client\` classes, are usually just some ""rmi clients"", not ""sanitized rmi clients"".

&amp;#x200B;

If we try to move sanitization and/or database-access out of the \`PlanClient\` class,

we are now required to duplicate the code across all users of the client class.

There's also an option of making a wrapper class, that calls the original class, then does the sanitization, like a decorator of some sort, but it needs some forwarding, and the naming game is hard :D.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you do in this situation? (even if it's a long-term refactoring plan)

Scenario: User sends a photo via an Android app to a webserver. Server must run some DL inference on the submitted picture, perform some calculations and send a text output back to the user.

Server will be a laptop with an RTX 2070. We were planning to make a Flask server, accept a POST request, then run inference by modifying darknet-YOLO to work with our model and weights. But that requires us to execute a command in the shell (with pexpect). But this doesnt seem like the best way, because if multiple clients make requests, they will have to wait for this command to complete/it may spawn several processes, risking a VRAM overflow/slowing down all running inferences etc with no control over them

I've found the python library MLQ to create a job queue and hand off the requests to a second process, but is there any way to make this as fast as possible, by running mutiple inference jobs in parallel on one GPU? In Python/Node.js etc.

Currently in the financial world and looking to get out. It has become a toxic work environment and I feel like I'm not gaining any new skills. To advance, I'd have to go into sales roles, which do not interest me. I was thinking of signing up at a Technical College near my house in their Software Development program to learn some new skills. The only experience I have was coding websites back in the early 2000's in HTML. My main concern is I have 2 colleagues who felt the same way about our job who quit, went to coding bootcamp, and a year later returned (with a whole bunch of debt) to the same job because they couldn't find anything in the Dev world. What I like about this tech college is they offer 2 externships with local companies along with job placement after graduation (82% success rate). These are two advantages I see over the bootcamps my colleagues did. In addition to that, it costs about 1/4 the price. It does take about 12 months, however, where their bootcamps lasted 6 months. I don't mind the extra time commitment, I feel like that will just give me more time to really learn the material. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my main question/concern is the course list. I'm not sure if the classes will give me relevant knowledge to be able to find a job after I'm done so I'm hoping someone can give an opinion on them. I honestly don't know what kind of jobs to be looking for once is all said and done, but I'm just looking to expand my resume a bit to create some opportunities. The course list is as follows:  **Introduction to Software Development,**  **HTML/CSS Basics,**  **Programming Basics,**  **SQL Fundamentals,**  **Linux Essentials,**  **Version Control Fundamentals,**  **Unit Testing,**  **JavaScript,**  **Java Programming I,**  **Java Programming II,**  **C++ Programming I,**  **C++ Programming II,**  **C# Programming I,**  **C# Programming II,**  **Database Development Fundamentals,**  **Web API Basics,**  **ASP.NET Applications,**  **PHP and MySQL,**  **Mobile Development: Android,**  **Mobile Development: iOS,**  **Software Development Externship,**  **Special Project I,**  **Special Project II,**  **Special Project III,**  **Math for Information Technology,**  **Microsoft Network Fundamentals** 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I should also mention I'm about to turn 34 but still feel like I'm 21. Not sure if that makes a difference but I guess it's a concern when I know there will be tons of CS graduates out there competing for the same jobs who'll have an advantage over me. My bachelor's is in finance and I've basically just done financial services roles since I graduated. Based on that background, is there any type of work out there where I can leverage this experience and combine them with the skills I'll pick up in school? 

Feel like this post is all over the place but can clear up anything with some editing.

1. handling customer requests:

         a. greeting 

         b. handle questions 

         c. handle requests (can i see the menu? can i add to my order?) 

2. taking and recording order: 

         a. taking orders and confirming 

         b. cancelling orders 

         d. altering orders

         e. recording all orders and pushing them once confirmed 

 ( Not important ) 3. communication for customer delight:  

         a. sending thank you notes

         b. sending seasonal greetings

         c. sending special offers &amp; discounts",2,2,2019-08-04 12:01:35

I wrote a recursive print function that iterates through a list of element. The function expects a list, and if one of the elements in the list is a list, then it calls itself. See the function below:

	def printLet(l):
    		for elem in l:
        		if type(elem) == list:
            			printLet(elem)
        		else:
            			print(elem)


From there I can write:

	a = [1,2,3]
	b = [a,4]
	c = [b,5]
        printElem(c)

And have it iterate through all of the elements. How would I implement this function using tail recursion?",3,2,2019-08-04 12:40:20

Am I approaching this wrong?","I programmed Forward Dijkstra's Algorithm in C++ with a small sample problem. Process time was 0.0 seconds.

I programmed Bidirectional Dijkstra's Algorithm in C++ with the same sample problem. Process time was 0.0 seconds.

I iterated both 1,000 times, and at first the forward was 7 seconds, and the Bidirectional was 4 seconds. This seemed about right since I thought Bidirectional should be approx doubly faster than forward by design. But when I made it so they printed the same amount of lines, I realized the only difference in time was the print time. (and they both ended up taking 4 seconds over 1,000 iterations.) 

Is this an indicator of a flaw in my code or logic? I don't know how to effectively demonstrate that Bidirectional is doubly faster.... Should I be looking at a bigger sample problem? I need to be able to fit it in a reasonably sized Matrix.

Edit: switched to milliseconds and there is a difference but it's very marginal (2100 milliseconds vs 2400)",2,3,2019-08-04 15:53:18

I started using [this](https://github.com/tojocky/node-printer/tree/master/examples) npm library to print the purchase number.  When I am developing in my local computer this library is working fine. I made it so that each time the user presses a button in the front end, I make a post request to my Nodejs Server which prints to the printer that I configured locally. 

The problem is that I want to eventually deploy my website to Heroku. Website will be used by a group of people sharing the same network and printer. I do not know of a way to set heroku to communicate with the printer using this package. 

I also thought that printing directly from the front end might be a better idea, but I have to open google on kiosk mode and then do the same for all the users that are going to use this website.

[Here](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/master/machine-learning/tutorials/IrisFlowerClustering/Program.cs) is a good example.

My company has what seems to be a propietary means of programming PLCs. It's a program that must be licensed individually through the higher corporation with limitations even for me as an employee. Here's the thing. The program used to manipulate the 'code', mostly graphical with a bit of state tables stuff, can only run one instance on a machine and can only have a single file open.  If I want to compare one file to another, I have to take notes or screenshots and switch between files. Much of the code blocks are very ambiguous with god awful documentation and shitty help files. I haven't delved into too many programming areas but I do enjoy Raspberry Pi projects as a hobby and worked on a decently complex real time data analysis setup for a testing lab in college using VBA of all god damn things, not my choice. Now that I'm in what I hoped to be a career, I'm worried the software development side of the business is trying to fix a doomed system.

Is this not an insanely difficult way for employees to work on their own company's programming software? For the method being essentially the same for nearly a decade, is there any hope of improvement?

Usually, the solution it gives is restoring some wifi-card settings which I haven't changed between two instances of a connection drop.

I tried searching for a solution for this problem everywhere, but no luck. Then I thought to ask if it's possible to write a simple program that basically checks connectivity, and if there's trouble, automatically launches troubleshoot and closes it after it's done.",0,3,2019-08-17 05:03:37

I started programming (in PHP) 17 years ago in my early teens, but I haven't done any significant projects lately, barring custom apps I build for myself to help me in my day job (systems administration).  I have an opportunity to build a website (more a suite of webapps) for a long term client, with a very flexible schedule and a good budget, and I'd really like to take it.  But before I do, I want to get a design down on paper and be comfortable with knowing I can accomplish those things before committing to the job.

The webapps are a type of eCommerce (but highly customized and doesn't fit prebuilt solutions), which sees a decent amount of traffic, currently coded in Classic ASP, they're running into major performance issues, especially with a single webserver/database server setup.  The code doesn't scale and doesn't utilize new hardware well enough to be efficient.  My plan is to propose a scalable solution using AWS Aurora as a MySQL backend, a lightweight JavaScript frontend, and a custom REST API using PHP.  I haven't learned enough about containerized applications just yet to be 100% sure, but in my head, the concept of packaging the front end/API so that I can ship it to multiple regions for scale/availability sounds correct.

So a few of questions:

1. Does this high-level design even make sense with the technology that's out there right now?
2. In a professional opinion, what language would you use for the API instead of PHP? Being in SysAdmin, I understand the security concerns around the language, even though I believe I have a good set of knowledge in it to secure it well enough
3. What modern concepts would you use to make the design more streamlined (development and deployment)? I mentioned containers, but I'm not even sure that fits

I really do appreciate any pointers, I've loved programming from a very young age and I'm really excited to learn some of these new concepts and create something awesome with them.  Once I finish the conceptual design document, I'll be taking targeted training on areas I need help in, so that I'm not going in blind.",1,4,2019-08-17 09:54:16

Back story, I have a son with high functioning autism. I have also worked with other children and adults with special needs and across the board this would be amazingly helpful. We will use my son as an example. Like most children he has no sense of time. This week it was brought to our attention that if he is excused from class to go to the bathroom he can take up to 20 minutes. At home he can take over an hour to eat even something simple due do distractions or getting bored. 

Kids, and adults, need something basic that they cannot change the time on and has visual as well as physical indicators. When I picture it in my head it looks like a basic Fitbit. The teacher, caregiver, or parent are able to control it through a simple app in their phone. For example, my son’s teacher excuses him to go to the bathroom on his own. She sets a ten minute timer for his “watch”. He goes down to the bathroom. After 5 minutes the “watch” gives a little buzz indicating the halfway mark. At ten minutes it starts longer vibration patterns. For the visual indicator I’m thinking a simple LED that slowly fades into a new color as the timer gets closer.

My question is: if I use some tool like matplotlib in python or some similar library in Julia to direct interpolate this data and generate a plot, it simply take ages to do.

I've meddled with Java and C++ in school, but never done any huge projects.

I work at a startup and developed a way of keeping track of our tasks using Google Sheets, and even wrote some script to shoot out emails when tasks were due. However, I knew it was a quick and dirty method of getting the job done, and as the number of projects we're doing increases, the more uneasy I'm getting about the stability and usability of the task tracking method I developed. It isn't anywhere near collapsing, but it's becoming harder and harder to implement new features because I'm pulling data from 30 different sheets into one main sheet, and any format changes I want to make must be done on EVERY sheet, and then I have to go update the email script. To make matters worse, the number of sheets grows with each new project that we take on.

As you can tell, it isn't the most ideal way of dealing with our requirement. From the beginning, I wanted to do a object oriented approach but was forced to settle for this due to time constraints, and the fact that coding really isn't my forte.

I have a little more time on my hands now, and wanted to take this up as a side project. I want to develop a application that's cloud based, available to employees on the go, where they can add/update their tasks, and where these tasks can be stored in some sort of central database.  There are Parts with properties like part name, part number, assembly name, estimated cost, etc. And each part can be assigned tasks with properties like manufacturing process, assignee, vendor name, start date, end date, etc.

Initially, my thoughts were to go with a Java based application with an SQL database because that's something I've done in the past. While that would be within my coding abilities, I felt like it would only work on a local system and would be difficult to put up on the internet where other employees could use it. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I was also suggested to use Grails coupled with Mongo, but then again, I don't know how to make that accessible to everyone over the internet. I'm willing to learn new tools I might need to for this endeavour, but I'm stuck because I don't know which direction to go in. It would be much appreciated if I could get suggestions on how and where to go about this.

Please do not suggest that I use a an already existing task management application! We've tried using a bunch of them, and none of them meet our company's needs. Plus, I really want to take on this opportunity to learn something new and useful. Thanks for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Adding clarification about my exact task management needs since a lot of you are asking about it. (Copied from a comment I made) 

&gt;We've tried Asana and Trello. Also took a  look at a few others like Jira, Kanboard, and Basecamp. While they  implement kanban very well, I can't get get ""objects"". Know what I mean?  
&gt;  
&gt;This  is a mechanical design firm, so in a project, I have several  assemblies. Each assembly has multiple parts, and each part needs to be  assigned tasks that roughly fall into the categories of study, design,  manufacturing, testing; and each of these categories can be split up into several more detailed processes (for example, under design we'll have consultation, 3D modelling, simulation, and 2D drawing). Often, we'll end up with hundred of parts in a  single project, and the tools I came across don't do a very good job of  giving me the in-depth tracking we require. This approach helps us track  things like lead time and create a final bill of materials.

Also, as some people have suggested, the best way to do this may be through a website. After some thought, this looks like the best solution so far. Our website will be up next month, and I'll talk to the designers to see if this can be implemented as a sort of employee login feature. If there are better ways, please do keep the suggestions coming!",27,18,2019-08-18 03:06:15

Installation instructions usually say something like this: (my paraphrase)   
&gt; You can build this software the hard way, or the easy way. The hard way is to use anything but Docker. The easy way is to use Docker. Just `docker-compose build` then `docker-compose up` and you're good to go! The hard way is bare metal. You have to install 306 dependencies and build 21 C++ modules on a machine running Red Hat Linux (which you don't own and have never used.) Don't even try bare metal unless you're masochistic or have a death wish.

But guess what? I can't make the Docker instructions work. I can, at least *some of the time* (maybe half), make the bare-metal instructions work. Out of the past 15 software packages I've attempted to install using Docker or Docker-Compose, one worked without error (the Kali Linux docker image.) Everything else failed and I was unable to fix with between 30minutes to 3hrs of trouble shooting (and in some cases two days.)

Yes, like I said, I suck at Docker. The problem is clearly not with Docker, but with me, because everyone else seems to make it work without problems, and then promptly sings its praises.",7,3,2019-08-18 09:54:09

I want to create a macOS and iOS (and iPadOS eventually) app. Due to its usecase I want to create a macOS prototype before making an iOS port, working backwards than many Apple apps these days.

Any recent and up to date resource to get me started? 

Also, quick question: Have devs started transitioning to SwiftUI instead of UIKit + TouchUIKit yet? 

(I already have some knowledge of Java, so glancing at Swift code, it makes a lot of sense. Just a different syntax. But actually building an app in XCode is very foreign.)

I have come across a problem while designing a system. The system will be requesting a set of data of it's users from multiple APIs from different services. Every API has their own limit, such as 1 user per request, 100 users per request per minute or 1,000 users per request per 10 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, my only solution is to have a queue system. Grouping the APIs depending on the limit, for example those in the 10 minutes, 1 minute and no limit. Let's say there are 10,000 users, so there will be 10 requests for each of the APIs with the limit of 1,000 users per request per 10 minutes and 10,000 requests for those that allow 1 user per request.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to see if there's any way to optimize what I am doing now. I can foresee that the data received will get delayed at an exponential rate as the amount of users grow. With 10,000 users, it will take 100 minutes to get a full cycle. But I guess that is to be expected anyway since the API itself has an imposed limit.",3,1,2019-08-18 11:45:15

Class A {

Int x;

//getters and setters for x 


@RequestMapping ...

Void SomeMethod() {

    SetX(5);

}



@RequestMapping ...

Void SomeOtherMethod() {

    //prints 0, value doesn’t persist

I have a function that simulates a user typing a string, printing each character of the buffer at a fixed delay.

But now, I want another behaviour. There has to be a random delay if the user wants, so it will now print each character at a random delay between two numbers.

1. If you add this behaviour to a separate function, it would be almost the same, a copy-paste, except that for now, it takes a tuple (float, float) that specifies the upper bound and lower bound of the random number to be generated.
2. But if you had this functionality on the same function that takes a fixed delay, you would need to add extra parameters, such as random\_delay to be true or false, and then another param to receive the tuple for the boundaries. 
3. You can also make the delay parameter, to take a tuple or float, type check it, and take the path accordingly to the type. The function also has the new parameter random\_delay that takes true or false. But this strategy and 2 leads to the question. **Doesn't a new behaviour lead inherently to belong to a new function?**

Since we have to send them in plaintext, we can't just hash them and store them that way. That being said, storing them in plaintext is clearly not an option.

The process I came up with is as follows:

1. Ask the user for a PIN (can be alphanumeric and as long as they want idc)
2. Salt and hash the PIN
3. Generate a random AES key and encrypt the ""secret"" which is then written to disk
4. XOR the PIN and the AES key
5. Write the result to disk

My line of thinking is that no one can get the AES key back out without knowing the salted hash of the PIN, which would require the knowing of the PIN.

Is there a better way to do this? And/or a more secure way? Thanks in advance

Edit: I should mention that the XOR key is longer than a single character, so it is not just a glorified substitution cipher

Edit2: Some answers to some questions u/moobied had for better visibility: API is third party, and we can either send the user's password to them or an access token. We support both, but no matter what that sensitive information needs to be encrypted. We also do not plan on storing the PIN, nor the salted hash; if the user enters the PIN wrong, we will know when we get a decryption error or a logon error",8,1,2019-08-12 10:05:14

The program I'm working on has several radio buttons. Two examples:

*) One set of radio buttons is ""Blocked"" and ""Alternating"" and results in the output being either blocked or alternated. 

Example: 

Blocked is selected, the output looks like this:

    ['A', 'B', 'C', '1', '2', '3']

Alternated:

    ['A', '1', 'B', '2', 'C', '3']

*) Other set is ""single"" or ""duplicate"". 
Example:

Single and blocked is selected:

    ['A', 'B', 'C', '1', '2', '3']

Duplicate and alternate is selected:

    ['A', 'A', '1', '1', 'B', 'B', '2', '2', 'C', 'C', '3', '3']

I'm not really after a piece of code, but a general concept of how to create something like this. There's many more settings aside from those I listed, but the general idea is the same: based on the parameters I somehow need to generate an array of varying length with elements of varying order. 

**I just need an idea for a concept; it doesn't have to be Python or array - I just can't think of a way to start writing this.**

Whoever has the highest view count at the end of the period wins. I set up a spreadsheet and dashboard in Google Data Studio already that allows me to manually update the counts of each, but I'm looking to automate this process.

I've looked into some of the API documentation for LinkedIn and Twitter, but it's honestly pretty above my head and I'm not even sure how to go about getting started. I know pretty basic-level Python and bash, but am just looking for the quickest / easiest way possible to do this to lessen my workload. (No tools I've found offer this functionality so far)

I finished an interdisciplinary arts degree and a computer science degree and we had exactly one class where we worked with GUIs, and that was Java class/OOP, and even then it was like create_rect(1,5); type stuff.   As you can tell, I feel like school was a waste of time where I didn't really learn anything, but whatever.


That said, I want to work my way up to making a very simple connect 4 game where I can click on a column and then have the coin fall in.  At the moment I have a (I believe) fully functioning connect 4 game for two people where you can set it between 7 to 98 columns.  I will eventually make it to where you can have like 5 players.  


Once I am happy with my clickable connect 4, I'm going to make an item based checkers/chess game where you can shoot pieces or make them invulnerable to being captured, maybe add teleportation and cloning or create shields.


But anyway, here's my code at the moment to show that I put in effort and am not trying to get someone to code my project.  I test my code like every other line with stuff like ""printf ""testing C.  You should see this.\n"") to make sure my program correctly progresses, so ignore the weird commented prints.

For example:

3,5,1,2

encodes the following:

BBB WWWWW B WW

Now suppose I want to change the pixels at positions 4 to 7 to Black:

BBB W BBBBB WW

The new encoded sequence is 3,1,5,2.

If instead I had changed positions 3 to 7 to black:

BBBBBBBBB WW

the new encoded sequence would be 9,2.

What I'm trying to find is if there is a simple algorithm for taking one encoded sequence, specifying a block of pixels to change to either black or white, and to then output the new encoded sequence.

Naively, one could decompress the sequence to a string of black and white pixels, make the change, and recompress it, but that's what I'm trying to avoid.

I've figured that I can work out where the new block lies, which blocks it overlaps, and various ways for dealing with all combinations, but it feels like there should be a simpler way.

Does anyone have any ideas? Or any proper names for some of the concepts I'm talking about that would help me to search for more info?

Notes: the first number always represents a black block, so it may be 0. The uncompressed sequence always has the same total length. I'm writing in C++ but I'm just trying to find a simple generic algorithm at the moment.",2,3,2019-08-12 18:31:48

157,157,cnx9gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/cnx9gi/i_wrote_a_switch_statement_in_lua_does_it_work/,"I wrote a switch statement in Lua, does it work like I think I does","So after reading about it on a couple different web pages, I made a pseudo-switch statement in Lua, which doesn't have switch statements.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

    local function switch(statement, input)
    	if statement[input] ~= nil then
    		statement[input]()
    		return true
    	else
    		statement.default()
    	end
    end
    
    local switch_numbers = {
    	[1] = function (x) print(""One"") end,
    	[2] = function (x) print(""Two"") end,
    	[3] = function (x) print(""Three"") end,
    	[4] = function (x) print(""Four"") end,
    	[5] = function (x) print(""Five"") end,
    	[6] = function (x) print(""Six"") end,
    	[7] = function (x) print(""Seven"") end, 
    	[8] = function (x) print (""Eight"") end,
    	[9] = function (x) print(""Nine"") end,
    	[10] = function (x) print(""Ten"") end,
    	default = function (x) print(""Error!"") end,
    }
    
    print(""Enter a number..."")
    local x = io.read()
    switch(switch_numbers, tonumber(x))

&amp;#x200B;

So the idea here is that this should save time over a stream of if/elseif statements. Let's say the user inputs something that's not in the table. If this was if/elseif, then the program would have to go through all ten results before knowing that its not on the table and returning the error message.

But (at least I think) with my ""switch"", all the program has to do is check to see whether the input is on the table by seeing if its a nil value on the table. If it isn't, then it'll instantly access the function at the value without having to cycle through each if/elseif. And if it does come up nil, then it instantly goes to the default.

Is that how it works? Or am I missing something?",1,2,2019-08-09 00:23:44

I like programming and it's fun, but I also get bored really easy. I worked in a kitchen for 3 years, as a CNA in a hospital for a year, and as a CNA in a nursing home for 3 years after that before graduating and getting a job in programming.

My days used to be hectic as hell and I loved every minute of it. I tend to stress out a lot so when shit hits the fan I actually relax because for that brief period of time all my focus is directed at something I can control. Now for the past 2 years I've been in web development and it's just not the same. I have so much energy in the morning and after 8 hours of work I tend to leave drained and more stressed out because all I did was sit at a desk and focus on a single (often monotonous task) for 8 hours.

I've gotten pretty good at getting up every 45min and taking a short walk and I think I'm going to start making more of a game out of my day, maybe impose some restraints on myself like challenges.

For other's who know what I'm talking about, where you're actually less stressed when everything is blowing up around you, how do you add that spice to your programming job?

One of my favorite things I enjoy about in interview is listening to a Technical Lead/Solution Architect sharing their reasoning of framework choices for the companies product/project. It is quite enjoying listen to different opinion on the framework that we all have been using/exposed to. 

I like to know more about how they make their decision for the ""best"" framework to use for a project. Couple of obvious reasoning I can think of are: using original framework for feature enhancement project, using specific tools requested by client, using specific language framework because library (like using django/flask because of python data analytic library), system integration required, human skill set resources. What about other reason? Like to pick a MVC (Angular) or View (React, Vue) for SPA. Or when to Client Side Rendering vs Server Side Rendering. Or other things I have not exposed to yet.

184,184,cldehq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/cldehq/high_performance_jdbc_connection_pooling_with/,High Performance JDBC Connection Pooling with Oracle Database,"#  TL;DR:

I'm an Oracle performance engineer concerned about connections storms on a very high-concurrency system with low latency requirements. I believe much of the system instability is due to an extremely rapid increase of connections stemming from a large difference in MIN and MAX connections configured in the JDBC (UCP) connection pools. I believe I need material on the danger of large, dynamic connection pools with high-performance databases caused by connection storms resulting from traffic volume changes and brief database latches/serializations. **Oracle makes this clear, but I need persuasive information for developers and middle-tier folks on this topic from well-known, respected, and/or trusted authors or resources in the (Java) development community.**

# Background context if you are interested or like to read:

Hello, I am a lead Oracle Performance Engineer for a very large financial institution, and I need some help from some knowledgeable Java developers. I'm looking for some expertise or assistance on the topic of configuring JDBC connection pools (specifically UCP if it matters) for a very high-concurrency, very low-latency OLTP application running against an Exadata Oracle RAC database ([12.1.0.2](https://12.1.0.2/)).

My understanding/perception is that developers and middle-tier engineers are often taught that connection pools should be dynamic in size (number of connections) to be scalable. This logic makes perfect sense to me. The only problem is that from a database performance perspective (at least for Oracle), large dynamic connection pools are very dangerous. In fact, for decades, Oracle's top performance experts (including their Real World Performance group) have said that most of the performance issues on which they are consulted have issues with the connection pool configuration, and that they spend much of their time explaining why large, dynamic connection pools, perhaps counter-intuitively, make the entire system less stable and more prone to ""connection storms"" and perceived timeouts/delays in query latency.

The reason for this is pretty straightforward from an Oracle DB perspective: establishing a new connection is one of the single most expensive (resource-intensive) operations for the database server and software. The reason is complex, but basically each new connection requires a fairly large amount of CPU, memory allocation, and internal latching to establish the session state required for the new connection (this all presumes Dedicated Server mode, not Shared). A new server process is forked for the session, memory is allocated for the session, much recursive (background) SQL is executed (and often requires parsing), latches are held briefly, etc.

The problem with large, dynamic connection pools when combined with very high-volume/concurrency databases is that, while most establish a relatively conservative INITIAL/MINIMUM number of connections, they often leave the MAXIMUM number of connections very high (or unlimited in some cases). I'm not sure if this is due to industry best practice, training, or the bias of almost every example of how to configure a connection pool in documentation and online, but I digress). Relational databases like Oracle have some operations that are inherently ""serialized"" or blocking. Over the last few releases, many or most changes have been made non-blocking, including as much DDL as possible. The problem is that almost anything else that causes some increased contention (a background job which cleans up orphaned entries in indexes, gathering daily optimizer statistics, creation of a new daily partition on a heavily inserted table, index contention, etc.) There are known workarounds for some of these issues, but not all, and even the workarounds move us away from automation and availability and back to requiring an outage for some maintenance and reverting to more labor-intensive and error-prone manual processes (manual drops of partitions and index rebuilds, pre-creation of partitions, gathering of stats offline or estimating them manually). Most of these things can be easily tolerated by most applications.

However, since traffic is based on human activity (transactions), the workload ebbs and flows (like most OLTP system workloads) and doesn't slow down for DB events! However, once we hit any number of known (or still to be determined) causes of very brief database serialization (required for consistency, durability, maintenance, etc.) will cause a very brief delay to many or all of the currently INSERTing DML records. Maybe stats causes contention, or invalidates the query requiring a hard reparse, or extents/space in a new partition need to be allocated, etc. The problem is, by t+1 second there are many hundreds of active sessions in the database (Oracle's activity-over-time data is captured once per second). By t+2 second there may be hundreds more. Then the database essentially runs like molasses, timing out all queries beyond their 3 second SLA, for between 1 and 8-9 minutes. This is a VERY bad problem for the business (another organization processes the records as ""stand-in"", but we pay dearly). *To the developers and middle-tier folks there is no other alternative but DB tuning. They reason that since the traffic coming into the system doesn't slow, the application server shouldn't throttle it in any way. The question is when does not throttling cause a part of the system (the database) to become the performance bottleneck?*

I believe the primary reason the system as a whole is so volatile and sensitive is that the connection pool treats the database as if more simultaneous work will deliver faster overall results, which is backwards. In fact, it's rather amazing the DB can recover from the added stress of the new connections being ramped up at high velocity (using CPU, latches, parse locks, and memory allocation), especially when all the sessions begin to wait on the same thing.

**My question is, how do I convince skeptical Java developers and middle-tier folks that this is worth investigating?** I have much literature from Oracle and various Oracle performance experts to document and even demonstrate the problem, and actually recommend a static pool configuration (MIN=MAX), as long as the min is set high enough. Basically the DB gets massively overloaded and as a result performance spirals downhill until the DB &amp; host somehow get through the wall of connections thrown at the database. I am well-respected in the organization, but I'm having peculiar trouble convincing this team to consider how they configure their connection pools. They have many small pools with a MIN of \~5 and a max of over 100 on each of the hundreds of app servers on JVMs. I realize having a static pool may be impossible when you use your app servers to spread the load like this, but there is even a product from Oracle called ""Database Resident Connection Pool."" It was originally designed for connections that didn't have access to their own pool (like Java), but recent versions include JDBC/UCP enabled pools. **I believe I need to find recognized experts or resources in the developer or middle-tier circles that give this advice (at least for Oracle databases) or explain the dangers of overloading the database with connection storms.**",3,1,2019-08-02 22:20:12

I really want to start working on projects ideas I have to improve my skills, and one idea is to build a home landing page for the wife and kids.  The idea would be a website they see whenever they hop on the internet, and it will list different things that are of interest to everyone in the house. (i.e. Weather, Family Calendar, Ongoing Projects, etc.) I understand a bit of how I can make the website work with js and some API's.

The part I do not understand is how to make this webpage appear whenever they get on the internet.  Something with DNS server connections, maybe?  Am i totally misguided on this idea? If anyone could help point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it.",22,20,2019-08-03 13:25:58

This is on Chrome Version 75.0.3770.142 running on Windows 7 Home Premium, Service Pack 1. I installed the extension Chromoji, which has allowed some emojis to render properly and in color, but others still appear as black boxes.

If I copy and paste the eye emoji I can see it, but then when the html renders it goes back to the black box.

195,195,cln9ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/cln9ic/how_to_represent_these_class_relationships_in_c/,How to represent these class relationships in C++,"Say we have classes for:

1. Company
2. Department
3. Project
4. Employee

* And we need to track which employees are in which department, what projects does a company have - etc.
* And also we need to read and write these to a file.

Would you use UUID variables in each object and have references to it in all the others? I tried that but ran in some weird C++ compiling problems (like what headers I need and how to #include properly) and got stuck.

I'm thinking I could use strings and keep the classes separate? E.g. a company (object) ""ABC"" has an employee ""John Smith"" (string) and an employee (object) ""John Smith"" has a company (string) ""ABC"", and when a query for employees comes in I loop through *all* the employees but only print the matching ones. (It doesn't need to be scalable).

As this is a school assignment, the idea is to use classes and no databases :(",3,1,2019-08-03 16:13:32

How do I go about running this sort of thing? I've been told this is not possible, however many deep learning libraries are just cpp wrapped with python so this is obviously possible. I'm new to hadoop, I have mainly a robotics/ml background.

Edit: thanks phone now it says pathing not python",0,1,2019-08-03 17:10:34
